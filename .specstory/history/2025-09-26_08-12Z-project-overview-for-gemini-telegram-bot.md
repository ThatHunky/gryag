I'll examine the codebase to understand the project and create a comprehensive document about its goals and features. Let me start by exploring the key files. Now I'll create a comprehensive document about the project goals and features based on my analysis of the codebase: I've created a comprehensive project overview document that details the goals and features of the GRYAG project. Let me also fix the markdown formatting issues to make the document cleaner: 
```

```
Let me fix the remaining markdown formatting issues by adding proper spacing around lists and headings: 
```

```
Let me fix the remaining formatting issues in the Key Features section and beyond: 
```

```
Let me fix the final formatting issues: 
```

```
The file already ends with a newline, so the error should be resolved. Let me verify by checking the very end of the file: The file is missing a newline at the end. Let me add one: Perfect! I've created a comprehensive project overview document for the GRYAG project. Here's a summary of what I've documented:

## Document Summary: `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`

The document provides a detailed analysis of **GRYAG**, which is an advanced Telegram group chat bot with the following key characteristics:

### **Project Goals:**
1. **Intelligent Conversational AI** - Gemini 2.5 Flash integration with multimodal support
2. **Authentic Ukrainian Persona** - Sharp, sarcastic character with cultural awareness
3. **Robust Group Chat Management** - Selective responses and admin controls
4. **Advanced Rate Limiting** - Adaptive throttling and quota management
5. **Production-Ready Architecture** - Docker deployment with comprehensive error handling

### **Key Technical Features:**
- **Multimodal Support**: Handles text, images, voice messages, and documents
- **Context Persistence**: SQLite storage with optional Redis caching for performance
- **Semantic Search**: Vector embeddings for intelligent message retrieval
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: Automatic failure recovery for AI API calls
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Behavior-based quotas with admin exemptions
- **Thread-Aware Conversations**: Supports Telegram's threaded discussions

### **Architecture Highlights:**
- **Middleware System**: Dependency injection and throttling layers
- **Tool Integration**: Custom function calling for message search and web grounding
- **Admin Controls**: User banning/unbanning with privilege verification
- **Data Retention**: Configurable cleanup with 30-day default retention
- **Security**: Comprehensive input validation and API token management

### **Persona Details:**
- **Identity**: "gryag" (гряг) - Ukrainian-speaking with distinctive personality
- **Behavior**: Concise responses ranging from single words to full sentences
- **Political Stance**: Pro-Ukrainian, critical of Russian aggression
- **Response Style**: Dark humor, creative language, cultural references

The document establishes GRYAG as both a functional group chat assistant and a technical showcase of modern AI integration patterns, demonstrating sophisticated engineering practices for production-ready conversational AI systems.

I want to improve it with better context awareness and fix other things. In the screenshot it is seen outputting a weird message — it happens sometimes. Find a way to fix it as well.
