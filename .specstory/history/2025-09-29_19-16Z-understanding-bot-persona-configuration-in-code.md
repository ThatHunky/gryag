# Understanding bot persona configuration in code (2025-09-29 19:16Z)

Which files are responsible for its persona? Lookup the code, the `persona.py` doesn't seem to affect it...

Plan: highlight where the persona text lives, follow how it’s injected into replies, and call out anything that could override it.

## Findings

- `persona.py` is the single source of the persona text. It exports `SYSTEM_PERSONA`, the multi-line string that describes gryag’s identity, tone, hierarchy, and tool usage.
- `chat.py` pulls that constant in (`from app.persona import SYSTEM_PERSONA`) and passes it straight into the model call: inside `handle_group_message`, the call to `gemini_client.generate(...)` sets `system_prompt=SYSTEM_PERSONA`. That means every generated reply is conditioned on whatever’s in `persona.py`.
- `gemini.py` shows how the prompt reaches Gemini. The `generate` method prepends the provided `system_prompt` to the `contents` array it sends to `generate_content_async`. Even though Gemini’s SDK models everything as user/model turns, that first entry is effectively the “system” instructions; if you edit `SYSTEM_PERSONA`, it’s the very first part Gemini sees before chat history or the new user message.
- No other file defines an alternative persona. The rest of the pipeline (`context_store.py`, middlewares, triggers) only add metadata, history, or throttling. So if changes to `persona.py` don’t appear to stick, double-check that the bot has redeployed/restarted with the updated file and that no cached build or environment is still using an old version.

### Why `persona.py` might look ineffective

1. Gemini can occasionally drift from instructions; short replies may feel off even when the system prompt is in place.
2. If the process was hot-reloaded, confirm the running container or service picked up the new file.
3. Long conversation history can dilute the persona; trimming history or reinforcing key points in the persona text can help.

## notes

- No code changes were made, so there was nothing to build or test.

Quality gates: Not run (read-only analysis).  
Requirements coverage: Explain persona wiring → Done.
