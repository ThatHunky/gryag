**Refining .gitignore entries**

I'm sorting out gitignore patterns, fixing `.ipynb_checkpoints/` as a directory, debating additions like `.envrc`, `.direnv/`, and exclusions like `media/` carefully to avoid conflicts, and making sure comments and sections are tidy and comprehensive for Python, environments, caches, and IDEs.

I'll craft a clear final message that acknowledges the task, summarizes what was done, and organizes details into sections like actions taken, files changed, quality gates status, and requirements coverage, making sure to mention no tests were run and referencing the assumptions about project root location.Dialed in comprehensive gitignore coverage so the bot repo stays clean and secrets-free going forward—here’s the rundown.

## actions taken
- Added a root-level `.gitignore` tailored for Python/aiogram projects, covering bytecode, build artefacts, venvs, coverage caches, Ruff, editor clutter, and Docker leftovers.
- Explicitly ignored sensitive configuration (`.env`, `.envrc`, `.direnv/`, keys/certs) while allowing template files like `.env.example`.
- Blocked common local data artefacts (logs, SQLite, pid files) and notebook checkpoints to keep history tidy.

## files changed
- `.gitignore` — new file capturing all ignore patterns listed above.

## quality gates
- Build/Lint/Tests: Not run (adding ignore rules only).

## requirements coverage
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` created for the repository: ✅ Done.

Give it a skim and let me know if you’d like variants for submodules or additional tooling.
