**Preparing to use terminal selection tool****Planning error resolution tasks**

I’m working through unclear instructions about fixing terminal selection errors, and it seems best to start by creating a todo list. Since the task likely involves multiple steps like checking logs, diagnosing causes, and fixing issues, I’ll frame the plan around those actions before diving into any commands or fixes.**Starting first todo****Reviewing recent Docker logs****Identifying and prioritizing errors****Investigating Gemini tool schema errors****Inspecting tool schemas for Gemini****Reviewing schema constraints****Adjusting schema and validation rules**

I’m figuring out whether to remove or restructure the `minimum` and `maximum` fields in the schema to prevent errors, leaning toward removing them while enforcing validations manually in code. I’ll also look into updating weather and currency tools to include explicit range checks and error responses to maintain expected behavior without relying on schema-level constraints.**Continuing exploration of context****Investigating schema and Markdown issues****Evaluating error handling and text cleaning****Considering markdown escape strategies****Planning markdown escaping and validation fixes**

I'm figuring out how to safely escape Markdown formatting to avoid parse errors while keeping support for bold and other styles. I'll remove minimum/maximum schema constraints, add manual validation for `forecast_days` in `weather_tool`, keep validation in `currency_tool`, and implement a helper to escape Markdown characters safely before sending messages, trimming to 4096 characters after escaping. I'll also handle embedding unescaped text separately and consider try/catch to fallback on plain text replies.**Preparing Markdown escape helper and validating forecast_days****Continuing line removal****Reworking forecast_days validation and currency schema**

I'm updating the forecast_days handling to carefully convert inputs like strings and floats to integers, rejecting invalid or out-of-range values, and ensuring the weather service gets robust input. At the same time, I'm removing the minimum field from the currency definition and planning to apply patches systematically for these updates. This feels like a good moment to tidy up the validation and improve error messaging, so everything is clearer and more fault-tolerant!

**Verifying removal of 'minimum' fields****Reviewing forecast_days handling and logging**

I'm carefully checking how forecast_days_value is handled, ensuring it properly converts and triggers forecasts only when valid, and considering whether errors should be logged or just returned. I'm also thinking about confirming that tooling definitions avoid outdated names and planning to run syntax checks and tests soon to catch any issues.**Re-running pyro process****Improving forecast_days conversion validation**
```

```
**Updating todo status and ensuring amount positivity****Preparing to run tests****Switching to python3 command****Handling bytecode compilation permissions****Investigating bytecode compilation issues**

I'm exploring why Python bytecode compilation may be failing due to permission errors on `__pycache__`. The environment variable `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` should prevent writing, but compile commands often still try to write `.pyc` files. Since the `__pycache__` directory might be read-only—possibly from running as root—I’m considering compiling to a temporary location like `/tmp` where permissions are lighter, using `py_compile.compile()` with a custom `cfile` path. This way, I can avoid permission problems while still verifying compilation.**Reviewing deployment status and next steps**

I'm checking if the executed command succeeded based on its silent output and considering running `docker compose logs` again to confirm no errors. I want to verify no git changes remain, ensure modifications like tool_logger accessibility are complete, and think about marking the fix step done while preparing the next task and a final summary.**Assessing repository state and marking tasks**

I notice the repo already has many tracked and untracked changes, with key files strangely showing as untracked despite existing previously. This suggests the repo isn’t clean or the git index might be in an inconsistent state. Still, I’ll focus on my specific changes in currency.py, weather.py, and chat.py, note that a new helper was added, and prepare to mark todo 3 as complete and todo 4 as started after confirming the build success and any bridging issues.**Preparing summary and marking progress**

I’m gathering details on the changed files to explain them clearly in the final message, including the removal of `minimum` and how I overcame compile permission issues by writing to `/tmp`. I’m also getting ready to mark todo 4 as completed once the summary is ready, ensuring everything is lined up for a smooth final response.**Preparing final detailed summary**

I'll create a clear final message that opens with a brief explanation of the user's issue and the actions taken. Then I'll organize it into sections covering modifications made, validation steps including how permission errors were handled, requirements addressed, and notes on next steps like redeployment and monitoring expected behavior. This should help the user understand what changed and what to do next.Digested the log failures you pointed out and tackled them head-on: first I cleaned up the Gemini tool schemas, then I hardened the reply formatting so Telegram stops complaining.

## actions taken
- Removed unsupported `minimum`/`maximum` keys from the weather and currency tool schemas and added explicit runtime validation for `forecast_days`, preventing the Google Generative AI client from throwing `Schema` errors.
- Updated `weather_tool` to coerce and validate the requested forecast length cleanly, returning a friendly error if it’s outside the 1–5 day window.
- Introduced a Markdown escaping helper in `chat.py` so replies are sanitized before sending; the bot now sends Markdown-safe text on the first try and only falls back to plain text if something truly unexpected slips through.
- Kept reply embeddings and stored transcripts in their original form while only escaping the outbound message, preserving history quality.

## validation
- Verified syntax by compiling the modified modules to temporary bytecode files (`chat.py`, `weather.py`, `currency.py`). Initial attempts hit read-only `__pycache__` directories, so I reran the check targeting ``, which succeeded.

## requirements coverage
- Resolve Gemini schema exception — **Done** (schema cleaned, validation added).
- Stop Telegram Markdown parse errors spamming the logs — **Done** (escaping helper plus safer send flow).

## notes
- After rebuilding/redeploying the container, watch `docker compose logs` for a bit to confirm the Gemini requests complete successfully and that Markdown errors no longer appear. If you’ve got a handy test chat, try a weather forecast request and a response containing underscores or asterisks to exercise both fixes.

Can you clean up with `sudo` those pycache folders?

**Planning cleanup of pycache directories**

I'm outlining a multi-step plan to identify and remove all __pycache__ directories, likely using sudo since some are root-owned from Docker. I'll create a todo list starting with locating these directories under app/, then removing them with sudo commands, and finally verifying the cleanup by rerunning compilation to catch any lingering permission issues. I'll try running sudo find commands cautiously to avoid traversal or incomplete deletes.**Handling sudo password prompt****Removing __pycache__ directories****Confirming command success****Verifying __pycache__ directories removal****Verifying compilation avoids permission errors****Marking TODO 3 as done****Preparing final message structure**Scoured the repo for those pesky `__pycache__` folders and wiped them with elevated rights, then double-checked everything’s clean.

## actions taken
- Enumerated all `__pycache__` directories under `` using `sudo find` (got the standard password prompt, but the command ran and listed them).
- Removed the directories with `sudo find … -exec rm -rf {} +`, clearing the root-owned caches that were blocking earlier compile attempts.
- Verified the cleanup (a plain `find` now returns nothing) and recompiled the touched modules via a `` bytecode target to confirm no lingering permission issues.

## validation
- `find app -type d -name __pycache__ -print` → no output (all caches gone).
- `python3 -c "…py_compile…"` targeting `` for `chat.py`, `weather.py`, and `currency.py` → no errors.

## requirements coverage
- Clean up `__pycache__` directories with `sudo` — **Done** (listed, removed, and verified).

You’re clear to regenerate caches as needed; they’ll now be owned by your user instead of root.

#terminalSelection look at this, it's erroring and spitting out *outdated* garbage. FIX!
