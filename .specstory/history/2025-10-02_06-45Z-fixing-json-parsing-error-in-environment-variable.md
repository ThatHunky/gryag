I'll help you fix the issue shown in the terminal selection. Let me first get the terminal selection to see what error we're dealing with. 

I can see the issue! The error is `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Extra data: line 1 column 10 (char 9)` when parsing the `admin_user_ids` field from environment variables. This typically means the environment variable is not properly formatted as JSON.

Let me check the current configuration to understand the expected format: 

Good! The code has a validator that should handle comma-separated values. Let me check the `.env` file to see what format is being used: 

Found the issue! The `ADMIN_USER_IDS` has a space after the comma: `392817811, 831570515`. While the validator should handle this, pydantic-settings is trying to parse it as JSON first (since it's a list type), and failing. The issue is that pydantic-settings sees `list[int]` and tries to parse the environment variable as JSON before the validator runs.

The fix is to remove the space after the comma, or better yet, update the validator to handle this case properly. Let me fix the `.env` file: 
```

```


Now let's restart the docker containers to apply the fix: 

Great! The containers started successfully. Let me check the logs to confirm the bot is running without errors: 

The issue persists. The problem is that pydantic-settings tries to parse the environment variable as JSON before the validator runs. We need to configure the field to parse as a string first. Let me fix the config properly: 
```

```


Now I need to update the validator to convert the string to a list, and add a property to access it as a list: 
```

```


The lint error is a false positive - pydantic-settings loads from environment variables. Now I need to update all the places that use `admin_user_ids` to use the new property. Let me search for usages: 

Now I need to update the handler files to use `admin_user_ids_list`: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```


Now let's restart the bot to apply the changes: 

Let me check the full logs to see if the bot started successfully: 

Perfect! The bot is now running successfully! The fix worked. Let me create a summary of what was fixed:

## Fixed! âœ…

The issue was a **JSON parsing error** with the `ADMIN_USER_IDS` environment variable. Here's what I did:

### Root Cause
Pydantic-settings was trying to parse `ADMIN_USER_IDS` as JSON before the field validator could run, because the field type was `list[int]`. The value `392817811, 831570515` (with a space after the comma) couldn't be parsed as valid JSON.

### Solution
1. **Changed the field type** in `config.py` from `list[int]` to `str`
2. **Added a property** `admin_user_ids_list` to convert the string to a list at runtime
3. **Updated all usages** across the codebase to use `settings.admin_user_ids_list` instead of `settings.admin_user_ids`
4. **Fixed the `.env` file** to remove the space after the comma (though this is now optional with the new approach)

### Files Changed
- `config.py` - Changed field type and added property
- `admin.py` - Updated to use `admin_user_ids_list`
- `profile_admin.py` - Updated to use `admin_user_ids_list`
- `chat.py` - Updated to use `admin_user_ids_list`
- `throttle.py` - Updated to use `admin_user_ids_list`
- `.env` - Removed space after comma (cosmetic improvement)

The bot is now running successfully! ðŸŽ‰
