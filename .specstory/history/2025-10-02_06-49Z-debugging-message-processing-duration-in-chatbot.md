# Debugging message processing duration in chatbot (2025-10-02 06:49Z)

_**User (2025-10-02 06:54Z)**_

Check out the chat and logs screenshot - still 0 ms. I don't think it is getting processed, please review the code and implement fixes.

I can see from the screenshot that the bot is handling updates but showing "Duration 0 ms" consistently, which suggests the message handler isn't actually processing the messages. Let me investigate the code to find the issue. 

I can see the issue! The `handle_group_message` function is not returning `await handler(event, data)` - it's just processing the message and returning `None`. This means the middleware chain completes immediately with 0ms duration because the actual message handling happens but doesn't count toward the handler execution time.

Let me check the middleware setup more carefully: 

Now I understand the issue! The middlewares are correctly calling `await handler(event, data)`, but the router handler `handle_group_message` is a direct handler function that doesn't return anything. In aiogram v3, the handler duration is measured from when the middleware calls the handler until it returns.

The problem is that `handle_group_message` processes messages synchronously in the handler, so it should be showing processing time. Let me check if there's an early return that's causing the 0ms: 

Let me check the triggers module to see how `addressed_to_bot` works: 

Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Looking at the logs:

1. Update `997959184` was handled in **4680 ms** (this one actually processed)
2. Updates `997959185`, `997959186`, `997959187`, and `997959188` all show **0 ms** (these are returning immediately)

The issue is that these messages are likely **not addressed to the bot**, so they return immediately at the early check. Let me verify this and also add better logging to understand what's happening: 
```

```

```

```


Now let me also add logging for throttle blocks and ensure we understand why messages might not be getting replies: 
```

```


Now let's restart the bot and check the logs to see what's happening: 

Good! The bot is running. Now let me create a summary document explaining what I found and what needs to be tested: 

Now I'll provide a comprehensive explanation of the issue and solution:

## Analysis Summary

Based on the logs and code review, I've identified the issue with the "0 ms" message processing:

### Root Cause
The bot is receiving messages but most of them are **not addressed to the bot**, so they return immediately after a quick check. This is working as designed, but the logging didn't make it clear what was happening.

### What's Happening:
1. **Update 997959184**: **4680 ms** - This message WAS addressed to the bot and got fully processed (Gemini call, fact extraction, reply sent)
2. **Updates 997959185-188**: **0 ms** - These messages were NOT addressed to the bot, so they return early after just caching the message for context

### The Code Flow for Unaddressed Messages:
```python
if not addressed_to_bot(message, bot_username, bot_id):
    telemetry.increment_counter("chat.unaddressed")
    await _remember_context_message(message, bot, gemini_client)
    return  # <-- Returns here, ~0ms
```

### Fixes Applied:

I've added comprehensive logging to make this behavior transparent:

1. **Initial message logging** - Shows all incoming messages with text preview
2. **Addressed vs unaddressed logging** - Clearly logs whether a message is addressed to the bot
3. **Throttle logging** - Better visibility when messages are throttled
4. **Processing status logging** - Shows when messages are actually being processed

### How to Verify:

The bot should now show clear log messages like:

- `"Processing message"` - for every incoming message
- `"Message not addressed to bot"` - when ignoring a message (0ms is expected)  
- `"Message addressed to bot - processing"` - when actually processing (should take 2-5 seconds)
- `"Message throttled - skipping Gemini call"` - when rate-limited

### Testing Instructions:

1. **Send a regular chat message** (without mentioning the bot):
   - Should see `"Message not addressed to bot"` in logs
   - Should see `"Duration 0 ms"` (expected behavior)

2. **Send a message that mentions the bot** (using @gryag_bot or "гряг" keyword):
   - Should see `"Message addressed to bot - processing"`
   - Should see processing take 2-5 seconds
   - Should get a reply from the bot

3. **Check the logs** to verify the bot is correctly identifying addressed vs unaddressed messages

The bot is now running with better logging. Try sending a message that mentions the bot and check if you see the improved log output showing it's being processed!

Well to the bot okay, but what about continuous processing? Meaning with processing user messages and actually learning about them, etc?

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Ah, excellent question! Let me check the continuous monitoring system to see if it's actually processing messages properly: 

Now let me check the settings to see if async processing is enabled: 

Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Let me check the current logs to see what's happening: 

Great! Now I see the key issue. Looking at the code and logs:

## The Issue

The continuous monitoring system **IS running**, but **async processing is DISABLED by default**. This means:

1. ✅ Messages are being monitored and classified
2. ✅ Conversation windows are being tracked  
3. ❌ **Windows are NOT being processed for fact extraction** (async processing disabled)
4. ❌ **Facts are NOT being stored automatically** (async processing disabled)

Look at line 230-245 in `continuous_monitor.py`:

```python
if self.enable_async_processing:
    # Queue for async processing
    await self.event_queue.enqueue(...)
else:
    # Phase 1: Just log, don't process
    LOGGER.info(
        "Window would be processed (async processing disabled)",
        extra=closed_window.get_context_summary(),
    )
```

The log message says "**async processing started**" but that's misleading - it's just the event queue starting, not actually processing events.

## The Solution

You need to enable async processing in your environment. Here's what to add to your `.env` file: 

Great! I can see **async processing is already enabled** in your `.env` file! Let me check what's actually happening:

Try again

_**Assistant**_

To ensure continuous processing and learning about users, the bot's continuous monitoring system must actually process and extract facts from user messages, not just log or classify them.

Here's what to check and
