# Updating Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents (2025-10-06 09:31Z)

_**User (2025-10-06 09:34Z)**_

Analyze this codebase to generate or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for guiding AI coding agents.

Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help an AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase. Consider aspects like:
- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
- Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection alone
- Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
- Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

Source existing AI conventions from `**/{.github/copilot-instructions.md,AGENT.md,AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,README.md}` (do one glob search).

Guidelines (read more at https://aka.ms/vscode-instructions-docs):
- If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, merge intelligently - preserve valuable content while updating outdated sections
- Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
- Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
- Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
- Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
- Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns

Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the user, then ask for feedback on any unclear or incomplete sections to iterate.

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll analyze the codebase to generate comprehensive `copilot-instructions.md` for AI coding agents. Let me start by examining existing AI conventions and understanding the project structure. 

Now let me examine more critical files to understand the architecture better: 

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me update the `copilot-instructions.md` with improved, actionable guidance based on what I've learned: 
```

```


Perfect! I've successfully updated the `copilot-instructions.md` file with comprehensive, actionable guidance for AI coding agents. Here's what I improved:

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Clearer Architecture Overview**
- Added tech stack upfront (aiogram v3, SQLite with FTS5, Redis, Gemini SDK)
- Explicitly called out the deprecated `main.py` shim
- Listed all critical service directories with their purposes

### 2. **Detailed Message Flow (Critical Path)**
- Broke down the entire request lifecycle into 8 numbered steps
- Emphasized **dependency injection** pattern (never instantiate services in handlers)
- Explained the 5-layer context assembly process with token budgets
- Documented the background task pattern (fire-and-forget asyncio)

### 3. **Data Layer Conventions**
- Schema management rules (always edit `schema.sql`, not raw queries)
- Metadata format with examples and sanitization rules
- Embedding storage format and rate limiting details
- Redis namespace patterns

### 4. **User Profiling & Fact Extraction**
- 3-tier hybrid extraction explained (regex → local model → Gemini fallback)
- Concrete file paths and configuration examples
- Fact storage, deduplication, and versioning patterns

### 5. **Testing & Development**
- Specific commands: `make test`, `pytest tests/`
- Local and Docker setup with exact steps
- Database inspection commands for debugging
- Logging configuration tips

### 6. **Extending Patterns**
- Step-by-step guides for adding handlers, tools, schema changes, fact patterns
- Examples from actual codebase
- Testing requirements for each type of change

### 7. **Common Pitfalls**
- 8 specific "don't do this" warnings based on actual codebase patterns
- Prevents common mistakes like instantiating services or skipping embedding persistence

### 8. **Phase Status Tracker**
- Current implementation status (Phase 1-4.1 complete)
- Links to detailed docs for each phase

## What Makes This Better

1. **Immediately actionable** - Commands and paths you can use right now
2. **Codebase-specific** - References actual files, functions, and patterns from this project
3. **Critical path focused** - Explains the "why" behind structural decisions
4. **Example-driven** - Shows concrete code patterns, not abstract advice
5. **Pitfall-aware** - Documents mistakes to avoid based on the actual architecture

The instructions now provide the "missing manual" that would let an AI agent (or new developer) quickly understand:
- How messages flow through the system
- Where to make changes for different features
- What conventions must be followed
- How to test and debug

Would you like me to:
1. Add more detail to any specific section?
2. Include examples for any particular workflows?
3. Document additional patterns I may have missed?

check logs of the bot

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll help you check the bot logs. Let me first see if the bot is currently running and then examine the logs. 

Good! The bot is running. Now let me check the logs. Since it's running as a process, let me check if there's a log file or if we need to check the systemd logs or Docker logs: 

Perfect! The bot is running in Docker. Let me check the Docker container logs: 

Great! The bot is running successfully. Here's a summary of what's happening based on the logs:

## Bot Status Summary

**✅ Bot is running healthy** in Docker container `gryag-bot-1`

### Recent Activity:

1. **Message Processing**: Bot is actively handling messages and using the multi-level context system
   - Processing time: 200-6700ms per message (depending on complexity)
   - Multi-level context assembly working properly

2. **Throttling Active**: User 659225732 hit rate limits in chat -1002604868951
   - Limit: 8 messages/hour (adaptive throttling)
   - Recent: 10 messages (exceeding limit)
   - Source: Redis (working correctly)

3. **Resource Monitoring**:
   - ⚠️ CPU usage spikes: 87.2% → 97.4% (CRITICAL at 09:44:46)
   - Memory: 53.2% (7941MB/14924MB) - healthy
   - Process RAM: 210MB - normal
   - **Resource optimizer** is actively adjusting levels (0 ↔ 1 ↔ 2)

4. **Fact Extraction**: Hybrid extraction running (~200ms per extraction)
   - Rule-based patterns checked first
   - No facts extracted in recent messages (expected for short messages)

5. **Continuous Monitoring**: 
   - Conversation windows closing properly (180s timeout)
   - Message classification working

### Recent Actions:
- **09:37-09:45**: Heavy CPU usage period (likely Gemini API calls)
- **09:38:13**: Conversation window auto-closed after timeout
- **09:42-09:47**: Resource optimizer adjusting levels dynamically

Would you like me to:
1. Show more logs (earlier or live/streaming)?
2. Filter for specific log levels (ERROR, WARNING)?
3. Check specific components (Gemini, Redis, database)?
4. Monitor resource usage trends?

check logs again, I couldn't remove facts for a user 

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I can see from the screenshot that you're trying to use `/gryagforget` command to remove facts about a user, but it's showing "Забув 0 фактів про користувача" (Forgot 0 facts about user). Let me check the recent logs to see what's happening: 

Perfect! I found the bug! There's a **TypeError** in the telemetry system that's causing the `/gryagforget` command to crash. Let me check the code: 

Found it! The problem is in how `telemetry.increment_counter()` is being called in `profile_admin.py`. The function signature expects keyword arguments (`**labels`), but it's being called with a `labels` dict parameter. Let me check line 240 too: 

Perfect! I found both bugs. The issue is that `telemetry.increment_counter()` is being called with `labels={...}` as a parameter, but the function expects keyword arguments like `**labels`. Let me fix both occurrences: 
```

```

```

```


Great! Now let me check if there are any other similar issues in the file: 

Perfect! All fixed. Now let's restart the Docker container to apply the changes: 

Excellent! Now let's verify the fix by checking the logs: 

Perfect! The bot has restarted successfully. Now let's create a simple test to verify the fix works. Let me check if there are any existing tests for the profile admin commands: 

Now let's wait a moment and check the logs to see if the bot is processing messages without errors: 

Good! No TypeError errors after the restart. Now let me create a summary document of the fix:

## 🐛 Bug Fix Summary

### Problem
The `/gryagforget` and `/gryagfacts` commands were crashing with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'` error.

### Root Cause
In `profile_admin.py`, the `telemetry.increment_counter()` function was being called incorrectly:

**Incorrect (before):**
```python
telemetry.increment_counter("profile_admin.facts_viewed", labels={"filtered": bool(fact_type_filter)})
telemetry.increment_counter("profile_admin.user_forgotten", labels={"fact_count": str(count)})
```

**Problem:** The function signature is:
```python
def increment_counter(name: str, amount: int = 1, **labels: Any) -> None:
```

It expects keyword arguments (`**labels`), not a `labels` dict parameter. Passing a dict as a parameter caused it to be treated as a key in the metrics Counter, which requires hashable types.

### Solution
Changed the calls to pass labels as keyword arguments:

**Correct (after):**
```python
telemetry.increment_counter("profile_admin.facts_viewed", filtered=str(bool(fact_type_filter)))
telemetry.increment_counter("profile_admin.user_forgotten", fact_count=str(count))
```

### Files Changed
- `profile_admin.py` (2 occurrences fixed, lines ~240 and ~332)

### Testing
✅ Bot restarted successfully
✅ No TypeError errors in logs after fix
✅ Ready to test `/gryagforget` command in Telegram

---

**The bot is now fixed and running!** You can try the `/gryagforget` command again in Telegram and it should work correctly now. The command will:

1. First ask for confirmation (reply to a user's message)
2. Show how many facts will be deleted
3. On second invocation within 30 seconds, actually delete the facts
4. Report how many facts were removed

_**User (2025-10-06 10:51Z)**_

add context hints for all commands please

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll add context hints (command descriptions and usage examples) for all commands in the profile admin handler. Let me first examine the file to see which commands need hints: 

Now let me read the rest of the commands to understand their current state: 

Now I'll add context hints for all commands. In aiogram v3, we can add command hints by using the `BotCommand` type. Let me check if there's already a command setup function: 

I'll add a function to register bot commands with descriptions. Let me update the `profile_admin.py` file: 
```

```


Now let's also add a global command setup function in the `main.py` or create a dedicated commands setup module. Let me check the admin handler too: 

Now let me update the `admin.py` file with command hints as well: 
```

```


Now let's check the chat handler for any user-facing commands: 

Good, `chat.py` doesn't have explicit commands. Now let's create a centralized command setup function in main.py:

_**User (2025-10-06 10:51Z)**_

@agent Try Again

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_


```

```


Now let's add the call to setup commands right after creating the bot and before starting polling: 
```

```


Perfect! Now let's restart the bot to apply these changes:
