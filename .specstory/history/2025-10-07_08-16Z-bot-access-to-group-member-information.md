# Bot access to group member information (2025-10-07 08:16Z)

_**User (2025-10-07 08:17Z)**_

Is it possible for the bot to see all group members and their info?

_**Assistant (copilot/auto)**_

No, the bot cannot see a full list of all group members or their detailed info due to Telegram Bot API limitations. Bots can only access information about users who interact with them (send a message, join/leave, or are mentioned), and cannot enumerate all group members or fetch their profiles directly. 

For admin bots, you can get a list of admins with [`getChatAdministrators`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getchatadministrators), but not all members. User info is limited to what is available in messages or via direct interaction.

Here’s the latest (as of October 2025) on the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api):

- **Bots cannot fetch a full list of group members**.  
  The API does **not** provide a method for bots to enumerate all members of a group or supergroup. Bots only receive user info for people who interact with them (send messages, join/leave, or are mentioned).

- **Bots can get group admins**:  
  Using [`getChatAdministrators`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getchatadministrators), bots can retrieve a list of admins (including their user info and custom titles).

- **Bots can get info about a specific user**:  
  If you know a user’s ID, you can use [`getChatMember`](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getchatmember) to get their status and basic info in a group.

- **Privacy mode**:  
  If enabled, bots only receive messages that explicitly mention them or are direct replies.

- **No mass scraping**:  
  There is no supported way to scrape or list all group members for privacy and security reasons.

**Summary:**  
Bots can only see user info for admins, users who interact with them, or specific users by ID (if known). There is no API to list all group members or access their full info.
