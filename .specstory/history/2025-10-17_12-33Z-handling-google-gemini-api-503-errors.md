# Handling Google Gemini API 503 errors (2025-10-17 12:33Z)

#terminalLastCommand fix the errors!

I'll check the terminal output to see what errors occurred. I can see the error! The issue is a `503 UNAVAILABLE` error from Google's Gemini API - "The model is overloaded. Please try again later." This is not a code error, but rather a temporary service overload on Google's side.

The bot is actually handling this gracefully with its fallback mechanism (you can see the log "Gemini request failed with tools; applying fallbacks"), but the error is still logged.

However, I notice that the bot successfully recovered and continued processing updates after the fallback. This is expected behavior based on the circuit breaker pattern implemented in the code.

**The error is temporary and not a bug in your code.** The bot's fallback mechanisms are working correctly:

1. ✅ The bot caught the 503 error
2. ✅ Applied fallbacks (retrying without tools, etc.)
3. ✅ Continued processing subsequent messages

**What's happening:**
- Google Gemini API is temporarily overloaded (503 error)
- Your bot has retry logic and fallbacks that handle this
- The bot continues working after the error

**If you want to reduce these errors:**

1. **Add exponential backoff** (if not already present)
2. **Switch to a less loaded model** temporarily
3. **Wait for Google's infrastructure to recover**

The current implementation already handles this error gracefully - no code fix is needed. The error logging is actually helpful for monitoring API health.

Would you like me to:
1. Add more sophisticated retry logic with exponential backoff?
2. Add a configuration option to use a backup model when the primary is overloaded?
3. Improve the error logging to make it clearer this is an expected/handled error?
