clean up unused docker volumes and stuff pls

I'll first create a short todo list and then list current Docker containers/images/volumes before pruning; expected outcome: identify unused resources and then remove them to free space. I'll run the listing commands and then a safe full prune (non-interactive). I'll report progress after the first batch. I'll run Docker commands to list containers, images, and volumes. This will show what's safe to remove. Expected outcome: get lists that let me decide what to prune. Progress update: I listed containers, images, and volumes. Next I'll remove dangling images and unused volumes safely. I'll mark the current todo item as completed and move to the next. I'll remove dangling images (those with <none> tags) using docker image prune -f. This should free space without touching images used by running containers. Expected outcome: dangling images removed. Progress: removed dangling images (zero bytes reclaimed apparently because images may share layers). Next I'll prune unused volumes with docker volume prune -f. This will remove volumes not referenced by any container — safe but irreversible. I'll run that now. Next I'll remove stopped/exited containers (if any). Currently all containers are Up, so nothing to remove. I'll run docker ps -a to be safe then skip if none. Progress update: I listed Docker resources, pruned dangling images and unused volumes, and confirmed there are no exited containers. Nothing large was reclaimed (0B) — likely because active images/volumes are in use. Next I'll suggest and offer to run a full system prune (aggressive) that removes unused images (including those not referenced by containers), stopped containers, networks, and volumes; but I'll explain consequences and ask for confirmation before running.
I listed your Docker containers/images/volumes and did a safe cleanup (dangling images & unused volumes). Summary and next steps below.

## What I did
- Listed all containers, images and volumes.
- Removed dangling (untagged) images: ran `docker image prune -f`.
- Pruned unused volumes: ran `docker volume prune -f`.
- Checked for exited/stopped containers (none found).

Progress (todo list)
- List Docker resources — completed
- Remove stopped containers — completed (no stopped containers)
- Remove dangling images — completed
- Remove unused volumes — completed
- Full system prune (optional) — not started

## Current Docker state (captured)
- Running containers (short list):
  - gryag-bot (Up)
  - gryag-redis (Up, healthy)
  - mqtt (Up)
  - frigate (Up, healthy)
  - webtest (Up)
  - npm (nginx-proxy-manager) (Up)

- Images: you have several large images in use, e.g.:
  - `gryag-bot:latest` (~902MB)
  - `henath-telegram-bot:latest` (8.95GB)
  - `ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/frigate:stable` (2.93GB)
  - `ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable` (2.04GB)
  - many others

- Volumes:
  - `gryag_models`
  - `henath_mongodb_data`
  - `henath_mongodb_logs`
  - `prolisky_mariadb-data`
  - `prolisky_redis-data`
  - `prolisky_wp-data`

- Results of prune commands:
  - `docker image prune -f` removed several untagged images, but reported "Total reclaimed space: 0B" (layers likely shared with existing images).
  - `docker volume prune -f` reported "Total reclaimed space: 0B" (volumes in use or nothing unused).

## Why little/no space was reclaimed
- Many images are tagged and in use by running containers. Pruning untagged images only removes layers not referenced by any existing image; if layers are shared, reclaim may be zero.
- Volumes listed appear to be used by containers (or there were no unused volumes), so pruning didn't remove them.

## Recommended next steps (two safe options)
1) Non-aggressive (what we've done): stop and remove any containers you no longer need, then prune.
   - To remove a stopped container: docker rm <container-id>
   - After removing unused containers, run:
     - docker image prune -f
     - docker system prune -f  (will remove unused networks/build cache too)
     - docker volume prune -f

2) Aggressive (one-liner, irreversible for unused resources): run a full system prune that removes:
   - All stopped containers
   - All unused images (not just dangling)
   - All unused networks
   - All unused volumes
   Command (non-interactive):
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a --volumes -f
   ```
   Consequences: this will remove any images that are not currently used by containers (including ones you may want to keep). After this you may need to re-pull large images.

I will not run the aggressive prune unless you confirm. If you want me to proceed, say "Yes, full prune" and I'll run it and report exact reclaimed space and resulting state. If you prefer, tell me which containers/images/volumes to remove and I will run targeted deletions instead.
