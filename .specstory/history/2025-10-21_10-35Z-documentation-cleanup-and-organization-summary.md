Cleanup docs from root

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll help you clean up the documentation files from the root directory. Let me first identify what documentation files are currently at the root level. Now let me check what's already in the docs directory to understand the organization: Perfect! I can see several documentation files at the root that should be moved according to the file organization rules. Let me move them to the appropriate locations:

**Documentation files to move:**
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` â†’ ``
- `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_PHASE_3.md` â†’ ``
- `IMPROVEMENTS.md` â†’ ``
- `QOL_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` â†’ ``
- `UNIVERSAL_BOT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` â†’ ``
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` â†’ ``

**Files that should stay at root:**
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` (allowed documentation)
- `LICENSE`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` (allowed configuration)

Let me move these files: I see that `IMPROVEMENTS.md` is not under version control. Let me move it using regular `mv` instead: Great! Now let me update the `README.md` to document these changes: Now let me update the `README.md` to add an entry about today's cleanup: 
```

```
The file has some pre-existing markdown formatting issues, but my edit was successful. Now let me also update the CHANGELOG: 
```

```
Good! The edits are complete. Now let me verify the cleanup was successful: Perfect! Let me create a quick summary of what was done:

## âœ… Documentation Cleanup Complete!

I've successfully cleaned up all documentation files from the repository root, following the strict file organization rules from `AGENTS.md`. Here's what was done:

### Files Moved:

**To `` (phase reports):**
- âœ… `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
- âœ… `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_PHASE_3.md`
- âœ… `UNIVERSAL_BOT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

**To `` (improvement summaries):**
- âœ… `IMPROVEMENTS.md` (not under version control - used regular `mv`)
- âœ… `QOL_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`

**To `` (guides):**
- âœ… `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Files Remaining at Root (Allowed):
- âœ… `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` (documentation)
- âœ… Configuration files: `.env.example`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, etc.

### Documentation Updated:
- âœ… `README.md` - Added changelog entry for cleanup
- âœ… `CHANGELOG.md` - Added detailed entry with verification steps

### Verification:
Both verification commands passed:
1. âœ… Root is clean - only `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` present
2. âœ… All 6 files moved to correct locations

The repository now fully complies with the file organization rules! ðŸŽ‰
