# Fixing markdown formatting issues in chatbot responses (2025-10-24 10:30Z)

_**User (2025-10-24 10:40Z)**_

Weird formatting error:

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I can see the formatting issue in the screenshot. The bot's response contains markdown formatting that's being rendered literally instead of being parsed. Specifically, I can see:

- `@{user_mention}` placeholder not being replaced
- Markdown formatting like `**PROTECTED1**` and `**PROTECTED2**` appearing as literal text
- The response appears to be showing raw markdown instead of formatted text

Let me investigate the code to find where this formatting issue is occurring. Let me check the response formatting function and the persona configuration: Now let me search for where the response is being sent to understand the formatting issue: I found the issue! The bot is using `_format_for_telegram()` which converts markdown to HTML, but the response from Gemini appears to contain raw markdown that's not being properly converted. Looking at the screenshot, I can see:

1. `@{user_mention}` - This is a template placeholder that's not being replaced
2. `**PROTECTED1**` and `**PROTECTED2**` - These are markdown bold markers that should be converted to `<b>PROTECTED1</b>` etc.

Let me check the `_format_for_telegram` function more closely and see if there's an issue: Now let me look at the `_format_for_telegram` function to understand how it processes markdown: Now I understand the issue! Looking at the screenshot, the problem is that the `_format_for_telegram` function is working correctly (converting `**text**` to `<b>text</b>`), but the actual display shows the markdown markers literally.

Looking more closely at the screenshot, I can see the message is rendered in the Telegram UI but showing raw text like:
- `@{user_mention}` - This is a template variable that wasn't replaced
- The bold formatting `**PROTECTED1**` and `**PROTECTED2**` appears to be rendered, but there seems to be an issue

Wait, let me look at the screenshot again more carefully. The issue is that the bot's response contains `@{user_mention}` which looks like it's coming from a response template that's not being properly processed. Let me search for response templates: Now I see! The `PROTECTED` text in the screenshot is actually coming from the `_format_for_telegram` function itself - it's the placeholder text `\x00PROTECTED{i}\x00` that's being shown. This means the placeholder replacement step is failing. 

Looking at the code, the function creates placeholders like `\x00PROTECTED0\x00`, `\x00PROTECTED1\x00`, etc., then tries to replace them. The issue is that these placeholders are being HTML-escaped (which turns `\x00` into an HTML entity), so the replacement doesn't find them.

Let me trace through what's happening:

1. `**PROTECTED1**` → captured by regex, replaced with `\x00PROTECTED0\x00`
2. Text is HTML-escaped → `\x00` becomes `&#x00;` or similar
3. Replacement tries to find `\x00PROTECTED0\x00` but finds `&#x00;PROTECTED0&#x00;` instead
4. Replacement fails, leaving literal `PROTECTED0` in output

The fix is to use a placeholder that won't be affected by HTML escaping. Let me fix this: 
```

```
Good! Now I've fixed the placeholder issue by using Unicode private use area characters (`\uE000` and `\uE001`) instead of null bytes (`\x00`), which won't be affected by HTML escaping.

However, there's still the `@{user_mention}` issue visible in the screenshot. This looks like it's coming directly from Gemini's response. Let me check if there's any template processing or if this is just raw Gemini output: The `@{user_mention}` doesn't appear to be coming from our code - it's likely being generated by Gemini itself. This suggests Gemini is trying to create a mention placeholder that's not being processed.

Looking at the screenshot more carefully, I notice the text is actually showing the markdown literally. Let me check if there's an issue with how Gemini is being instructed. Let me look at the persona to see if it explicitly forbids markdown: Let me check the persona more specifically: Perfect! I found the issue. The persona says **"Plain text only. No asterisks, no underscores for emphasis, no decorative markdown."** BUT Gemini is still outputting markdown (like `**PROTECTED1**`, `**PROTECTED2**`), and it's also outputting `@{user_mention}` which looks like it's trying to create a template variable.

The problem is twofold:
1. Gemini is ignoring the "no markdown" instruction and outputting `**bold**` syntax
2. Gemini is outputting `@{user_mention}` which looks like a template placeholder

Looking at the screenshot again, the actual rendered text shows:
- `@{user_mention} ти в своєму репертуарі, батько.` 
- Then some text about PROTECTED1 and PROTECTED2

This suggests Gemini is creating its own template-like syntax that we're not processing. The `_format_for_telegram` function tries to convert markdown to HTML, but if the placeholders get corrupted during HTML escaping, they show up literally.

Let me create a test to verify the fix works: Great! All tests pass. Now let me add a specific test case for the bug we saw to ensure it's fixed: Perfect! Now let me add a specific test for the exact bug we saw (PROTECTED text showing literally): 
```

```
The lint error is a pre-existing issue (not from our changes). Let's run the tests to verify our fix works: Ah, the test is almost passing - the only difference is that single quotes `'` are being HTML-escaped to `&#x27;`. Let me update the expected value: 
```

```
Perfect! Now let's run all the formatting tests to make sure nothing broke: Excellent! All tests pass. Now let me create a simple test to verify the fix works end-to-end: Perfect! The formatting is now working correctly. Now let me document the fix: The markdown linting errors are cosmetic - the documentation is still valid. Now let's update the README to document this fix: 
```

```
The lint warnings are pre-existing and not related to our change. Now let's verify the entire test suite still works: Great! All formatting tests pass. Now let's create a summary document:

## Summary

I've successfully fixed the weird formatting error you showed in the screenshot. The issue was that markdown formatting like `**PROTECTED1**` and `**PROTECTED2**` was showing up literally instead of being converted to bold text.

### What was wrong:

The `_format_for_telegram()` function uses temporary placeholders when converting markdown to HTML. It was using null bytes (`\x00PROTECTED0\x00`) as placeholders, but when the text was HTML-escaped, these null bytes became HTML entities like `&#x00;`, which broke the placeholder replacement logic. This caused the literal text "PROTECTED0", "PROTECTED1", etc. to appear in messages.

### What I fixed:

Changed the placeholders from null bytes to Unicode Private Use Area characters (`\uE000TGFMT{n}\uE001`), which:
- Survive HTML escaping unchanged
- Don't appear in normal user text
- Work reliably for the formatting pipeline

### Changes made:

1. **`chat.py`** - Updated `_format_for_telegram()` function to use safe Unicode placeholders
2. **`test_telegram_formatting.py`** - Added test case for the specific bug
3. **`telegram-formatting-placeholder-bug-2025-10-24.md`** - Documented the fix
4. **`README.md`** - Added entry in Recent Changes

### Verification:

All 21 formatting tests pass, including the new test for this specific bug:

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_telegram_formatting.py -v
```

The bot will now correctly format markdown as HTML for Telegram. Bold text (`**text**`), italic (`*text*`), and spoilers (`||text||`) all work properly.

_**User (2025-10-24 10:53Z)**_

also my username is `@vsevolod_dobrovolskyi` but it formatted it without the underscore. Fix that also.

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll check the current state of the formatting function and fix the underscore issue. Let me first see what's happening: Good, the underscore is preserved in simple text. Let me check what happens when there's italic formatting nearby: The underscore is being preserved correctly in our formatting function. The issue you saw must be from Gemini's response itself - it's outputting the text without the underscore. Let me check the persona to see if there's an issue with how usernames are mentioned: I see the persona has the correct username with underscore. The issue is that Gemini is generating text that doesn't include the underscore when it mentions you. Let me check if there's something in the formatting instructions that might be causing this: Ah! I see the problem now. The persona says:

> **Formatting**: Plain text only. No asterisks, **no underscores for emphasis**, no decorative markdown. Simple lists with `-` or `*` are fine. **Keep underscores in usernames/tokens where they belong.**

This is actually correct and tells Gemini to keep underscores in usernames. However, Gemini is interpreting "no underscores for emphasis" too broadly and removing underscores everywhere, including in usernames.

The issue is that when Gemini sees `_` in text, our formatting function thinks it might be italic markdown and tries to process it. But actually, looking at the screenshot again, the issue is that Gemini itself is outputting `@vsevoloddobrovolskyi` without the underscore - it's not a formatting problem, it's Gemini not following the instruction.

Let me make the persona instruction more explicit and emphatic about preserving underscores in usernames: 
```

```
Good! Now let me also check if there's an issue with how italic markdown detection works that might interfere with underscores in usernames. Let me test the formatting function more thoroughly: Ah! There's the problem! The formatting function is incorrectly treating underscores in usernames as italic markers. The issue is that usernames like `@test_user_name` have underscores that match the italic pattern `_text_`.

I need to fix the `_format_for_telegram()` function to not treat underscores within `@username` patterns as italic markers. Let me update it: Now I need to fix the function to protect Telegram usernames (starting with `@`) before processing markdown: 
```

```
Now let's test if the fix works: Perfect! Now let's run the full test suite to make sure nothing broke: Excellent! All tests pass. Now let's add a specific test for username preservation: 
```

```
Perfect! Let's run all the tests one more time to ensure everything works: Excellent! All tests pass. Now let's update the documentation: 
```

```
The linting errors are cosmetic. Let's update the main README: 
```

```
Perfect! Let's create one final comprehensive test to make sure everything works together: Perfect! Everything works. Let's run a quick sanity check on the full test suite: Excellent! All tests pass. Let me create a quick summary:

## Summary

I've fixed both formatting issues:

### Issue 1: PROTECTED placeholder text showing literally
**Cause**: Null bytes in placeholders (`\x00PROTECTED0\x00`) were being HTML-escaped, breaking replacement logic.

**Fix**: Changed to Unicode Private Use Area characters (`\uE000TGFMT{n}\uE001`) which survive HTML escaping.

### Issue 2: Username underscores being removed
**Cause**: The formatter was treating underscores in usernames like `@vsevolod_dobrovolskyi` as italic markdown delimiters, converting them to `@vsevolod<i>dobrovolskyi</i>`.

**Fix**: 
1. Added username protection step that extracts `@username` patterns before markdown processing
2. Strengthened persona instructions to explicitly state: "When mentioning Telegram usernames (like @vsevolod_dobrovolskyi or @Qyyya_nya), ALWAYS include the underscore character exactly as shown"

### Changes Made:

1. **`chat.py`** - Updated `_format_for_telegram()`:
   - Safe Unicode placeholders
   - Username pattern protection (regex: `@[a-zA-Z0-9_]{5,32}`)
   - Separate handling for raw content (usernames) vs formatted content

2. **`persona.py`** - Made username formatting instruction more explicit and emphatic

3. **`test_telegram_formatting.py`** - Added comprehensive test for username underscores

4. **`telegram-formatting-placeholder-bug-2025-10-24.md`** - Updated documentation

5. **`README.md`** - Updated Recent Changes entry

### Verification:
✅ All 22 formatting tests pass  
✅ Usernames with underscores preserved correctly  
✅ Markdown formatting works (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `||spoilers||`)  
✅ No more PROTECTED placeholders showing

The bot will now correctly format all responses and preserve your username `@vsevolod_dobrovolskyi` with the underscore intact!

_**User (2025-10-24 11:06Z)**_

Still a bit weird.

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Looking at the screenshot, I can see the bot's response has some odd formatting issues:

1. The text appears to have escaped backslashes and quotes showing literally
2. There are code-like snippets visible (`\-` sequences, escaped quotes)
3. The formatting looks like raw Python string literals are leaking through

Let me check what's in the actual response: I see the problem! The text Gemini is generating contains **escaped Markdown characters** (like `\-`, `\.`, `\~`) which are meant for MarkdownV2 format, but we're using HTML format. These escaped characters are showing up literally.

The issue is that Gemini is generating text formatted for Telegram's MarkdownV2 parse mode (which requires escaping special characters with `\`), but we're sending messages with HTML parse mode instead.

Looking at the screenshot, I can see escaped sequences like:
- `\-` (escaped dash)
- `\.` (escaped period) 
- `\~` (escaped tilde)
- `\[` and `\]` (escaped brackets)
- `\"` (escaped quotes)

The formatter needs to remove these escape backslashes when converting to HTML. Let me update it: I need to add a step to remove MarkdownV2 escape sequences. Let me update the function: 
```

```
I see there's a duplicate "Step 2" comment. Let me fix that: 
```

```
Now let's test the fix: Perfect! Now let's run all the formatting tests to make sure nothing broke: Excellent! All tests pass. Now let's add a test specifically for MarkdownV2 escapes and update the documentation: I need to add comma to the list of characters to unescape. Let me update the regex: 
```

```
Perfect! All 23 tests pass. Now let's update the documentation: 
```

```
Perfect! Let's rebuild and restart the bot to test the fix: Great! The bot is rebuilt and running. Let me create a summary of all the fixes:

## Summary of Formatting Fixes

I've fixed **three** critical formatting issues:

### Issue 1: PROTECTED placeholder text ✅
**Problem**: Literal "PROTECTED0", "PROTECTED1" showing in messages instead of formatted text.  
**Cause**: Null byte placeholders (`\x00`) were HTML-escaped, breaking replacement.  
**Fix**: Use Unicode Private Use Area characters (`\uE000`, `\uE001`).

### Issue 2: Username underscores removed ✅
**Problem**: `@vsevolod_dobrovolskyi` formatted as `@vsevolod<i>dobrovolskyi</i>`.  
**Cause**: Underscores treated as italic markdown delimiters.  
**Fix**: Protect `@username` patterns before markdown processing.

### Issue 3: MarkdownV2 escape sequences ✅  
**Problem**: Literal `\-`, `\.`, `\!`, `\,` showing in messages (from your screenshot).  
**Cause**: Gemini generates text with MarkdownV2 escapes (for MarkdownV2 parse mode), but we use HTML parse mode.  
**Fix**: Strip escape backslashes before special characters: `_ * [ ] ( ) ~ ` > # + - = | { } . ! ,`

### Changes Made:

1. **`chat.py`** - Updated `_format_for_telegram()`:
   - Step 0: Remove MarkdownV2 escape sequences
   - Step 1: Protect usernames
   - Step 2: Process markdown formatting
   - Step 3: HTML-escape
   - Step 4: Restore placeholders

2. **`persona.py`** - Explicit username formatting instruction

3. **`test_telegram_formatting.py`** - Added test for MarkdownV2 escapes

4. **`README.md`** - Updated Recent Changes

### Verification:
✅ All 23 formatting tests pass  
✅ Bot rebuilt and running with fixes  

The bot should now display clean, properly formatted responses without any weird escape sequences or placeholder text!

Sometimes this happens (I think it's from using information from web search)... Look into the issue.

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Looking at the screenshot, I can see the bot is outputting text with checkmark emojis (✓) and special Unicode symbols (like 🗨️) mixed with italic text formatting. The checkmarks appear to be rendered, but the formatting looks messy with many italic sections.

This seems to be happening when the bot uses web search results or generates structured content. Let me investigate:

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Looking at the screenshot, I can see the bot's response is displaying checkmark emojis (✓) followed by escaped Unicode sequences like `🗘TGFMT1`, `🗘TGFMT2`, etc., along with what appears to be web search result formatting with lots of checkmarks.

This suggests that when Gemini returns web search results, it's including special formatting that's being partially processed by our formatter. The issue is that the response contains literal Unicode private use area characters that we use as placeholders!

Let me investigate: That's not showing the placeholder characters - they're displaying as different emojis. Let me check what those characters actually are: Aha! The screenshot shows `0x1f5d8` which is 🗘 (a document/notepad emoji). But we're using `0xe000` which is in the Unicode Private Use Area. This means Gemini is **generating text that literally contains our placeholder patterns**, not that our placeholders are leaking through.

Let me check what Gemini actually returned:

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Interesting! The screenshot shows `\u1f5d8` (🗘) which is NOT our placeholder character `\ue000`. But looking more carefully at the image, I can see the actual problem:

The text shows things like `🗘TGFMT1`, `🗘TGFMT2` which look suspiciously like our placeholders but with a different character. This might be a rendering issue OR Gemini might be generating text that coincidentally includes our placeholder pattern!

Let me check the actual formatting function more carefully:
