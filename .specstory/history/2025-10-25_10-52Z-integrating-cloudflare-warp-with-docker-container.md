# Integrating Cloudflare WARP with Docker container (2025-10-25 10:52Z)

_**User (2025-10-25 10:56Z)**_

Plan adding Cloudflare WARP to the container so the bot has some privacy layer to it.

**Planning Cloudflare WARP Integration**

I need to respond as an AI programming assistant regarding the user's request to add Cloudflare WARP for privacy. I’ll propose adding the Cloudflare WARP Client inside a Docker container or utilizing Cloudflare Zero Trust WARP for outgoing traffic. There are some complexities, such as requiring a TUN device for WARP CLI, and I might consider using the userspace WireGuard implementation. Using a sidecar container with tinyproxy or SOCKS5 via warp-svc could also work.**Outlining the Project Structure**

I need to provide a plan that includes steps for modifications to the Dockerfile, updates to docker-compose, and possibly scripts organized under the scripts directory. It's important to adhere to the file organization rules, meaning no root files should be created apart from the allowed configs. Since modifications are being suggested, I’ll recommend changes to the existing docker-compose.yml while ensuring to format my responses with Markdown and using code blocks for clarity.**Proposing WARP Integration Approaches**

I need to outline a plan with steps and choose among different approaches for integrating WARP. One option is using a sidecar "warp" container that sets up WARP and exposes a local SOCKS5 proxy, or routing traffic through iptables with a shared network namespace so the bot container shares it with the warp container. I could run WARP in a privileged container using the official Cloudflare WARP Linux client and set up the required services directly, while considering the registration process.**Registering and Configuring WARP**

For headless registration, I can use warp-cli register without needing a login. Then, I set the mode to proxy and enable it, which creates a local SOCKS5 proxy on 127.0.0.1:40000. This setup can be utilized by the bot container through the HTTPS_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY, and ALL_PROXY environment variables while connecting to the warp container's hostname and port. The proxy mode is straightforward, supporting outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic, which is perfect for the Telegram bot. I’ll suggest using a warp image Dockerfile in scripts or create a new service using the Cloudflare WARP Debian repo.**Creating a WARP Docker Setup**

I’m considering using third-party images like ghcr.io/mahdibland/cloudflare-warp or monius/docker-cloudflare-warp, but it might be better to create my own minimal Docker image based on Debian or Ubuntu. I’ll place a new Dockerfile for the WARP sidecar in the scripts/warp directory to stay within project rules. I also need to provide an entrypoint script to start warp-svc, register, and enable proxy mode. 

For better compatibility, I'll use Debian bookworm as the base image. The entrypoint will handle the installation of Cloudflare WARP and set it up. I'll ensure to expose port 40000 and set up proxy configurations for the bot service using environment variables. To give the user options, I’ll propose two modes: a simpler proxy mode and a full-tunnel mode with network namespace sharing, recommending the latter for better privacy without needing significant code changes to their app.**Planning Docker Setup with WARP**

I’m planning to run a Docker container with /dev/net/tun and certain capabilities. In the Docker Compose file, I’ll add a WARP service, building from a Dockerfile in scripts/warp, which will add required capabilities and devices. The bot will share the network with the WARP container. 

I'll create an entrypoint script to handle registration and connection for the WARP service. Once everything is in place, I’ll verify the setup and provide options to switch to proxy mode.

For testing, I’ll check connectivity and IP leaks, and outline rollback options if needed. It’s important to ensure documentation is clear and adheres to project rules regarding changes. I’ll present all necessary code snippets and follow Markdown formatting guidelines.**Setting Up Docker Capabilities**

I need to set capabilities in the Docker Compose file. This includes adding NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW, mapping the tun device, and ensuring IPv6 is enabled. I might also want to set the WARP_LOG_LEVEL to info. 

For the health check, I should use a command that verifies the connection status effectively. In the bot service, I'll adjust the network mode to "service:warp" and make it depend on a healthy warp service. It’s essential to keep the changes minimal and possibly suggest documentation updates later.Here’s a safe, minimal plan to add Cloudflare WARP as a sidecar and route all bot egress through it (full-tunnel). It keeps your repo structure rules and doesn’t require code changes in the app.

Recommended approach: full-tunnel sidecar (transparent)
- Pros: App needs no proxy config; all outbound traffic goes through WARP.
- Cons: Sidecar needs /dev/net/tun and NET_ADMIN in Docker.

What we’ll add/modify:
- New image for WARP in scripts/warp/
- Entrypoint to bootstrap WARP and keep it connected
- `docker-compose.yml` changes: add warp service and make bot share its network namespace

docker-compose changes

- Add a warp service built from scripts/warp/.
- Share its network namespace with the bot service (network_mode: "service:warp").
- Move any port mappings to the warp service if the bot exposed ports (most Telegram bots don’t need inbound ports).

    # If you previously exposed ports here, move them to the warp service now.

# ...existing code...
````

How to run and verify

- Start sidecar first, then the bot:
  - docker compose up -d warp
  - docker compose up -d bot
- Verify egress IP from inside the bot:
  - docker compose exec bot sh -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl >/dev/null 2>&1 || true; curl -s https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace | grep ip"
  - Expect an IP not tied to your host/provider (Cloudflare egress).
- If troubleshooting:
  - docker compose logs -f warp
  - docker compose exec warp warp-cli --accept-tos status

Alternative (proxy mode, no TUN/caps)
- Run WARP in proxy mode and set ALL_PROXY=socks5h://warp:40000 in the bot.
- Pros: no NET_ADMIN, no /dev/net/tun.
- Cons: requires SOCKS support in HTTP client libraries; some libs need extra packages.

If you want this proxy variant, I can provide a minimal variant of the Dockerfile/compose for socks5 on port 40000.

Will this implementation work *only* for the bot container? I don't want anything else to go through.

**Clarifying WARP implementation**

I need to clarify whether this implementation will work solely for the bot container. The goal is to ensure that only bot traffic routes through WARP. Our initial plan was to use a WARP sidecar and set the bot's service `network_mode` to "service:warp," which confines the shared network to just this bot. It's crucial to be precise, as only containers opting for `network_mode: "service:warp"` will share the network namespace, while others stay on their default network. I'll also add notes on keeping other containers in default networks and adjustments for docker-compose settings.**Confirming egress IP**

To confirm that the egress IP remains unchanged, I can run a `curl` command from another service. Since there are developer constraints, I'll stick to Markdown formatting and use code blocks fenced with four backticks for any code snippets. The user simply asked a question, so no code changes are necessary. I’ll keep my answer concise and impersonal, suggesting I use `docker compose exec <service>` to check the IP on Linux while being aware of how Cloudflare WARP affects network namespaces. Also, I’ll mention not to place both services in the same custom network.**Clarifying network effects**

I should clarify that only containers sharing the WARP namespace will be affected, and it's essential not to use the bot service's `network_mode` for other services. If external proxies or environment variables are in play, they shouldn't be used. An alternative architecture, like a dedicated Docker network using WARP as a gateway, can be complex, so `network_mode` is the simplest option. Also, since the bot doesn't expose ports, it's fine. They only asked about scoping, and I'll respect the policy about naming conventions. I'll avoid creating unnecessary files and stick to explanations and verification commands.**Clarifying WARP usage**

Yes, only the bot will use WARP because setting `network_mode: service:warp` isolates it to the shared network namespace, leaving other services on the default Docker network unaffected. It's crucial not to set the `network_mode` for any other services, ensure the host network isn't used, and avoid enabling WARP at the host level.

To verify this, I'll show commands to compare the egress IP of the bot and another service, like a database or alpine container. I should also mention that if the bot starts sibling containers with `--network container:warp`, those will be tunneled, and running commands in a shell attached to the WARP container will also be tunneled.**Addressing WARP and DNS**

I need to keep an eye on DNS since WARP overrides `resolv.conf`. If another service uses a Compose "dns:" override, it won't share the network. For per-process level routing, I could suggest using proxy mode by setting `ALL_PROXY` inside the bot. But the key question is whether this implementation works only for the bot container—yes, it does with `network_mode: "service:warp"`.

I should keep it brief and include a verification snippet, like `docker compose exec bot curl ip info` or to check egress using a temporary container on the default network. Additionally, I need to mention three gotchas: setting `network_mode: host` will bypass WARP, `depends_on` won't impact containers with `network_mode: service:warp`, and DNS leaks can occur if warp-svc sets 1.1.1.1. Finally, if WARP is down, the bot won't be able to resolve, but other services will not be affected.Yes. With network_mode: "service:warp", only containers that explicitly share the WARP sidecar’s network namespace will be tunneled. All other services stay on their normal Docker network and use your host’s egress as usual.

Scope rules
- Tunneled: warp container itself and any service using network_mode: "service:warp" (your bot).
- Not tunneled: every other service that does not opt-in to that network_mode.
- Don’t set host-level WARP or change the host’s routes; this plan doesn’t touch the host.

Quick verification
- Bot (should show Cloudflare egress):
  - docker compose exec bot sh -lc 'apk add --no-cache curl >/dev/null 2>&1 || apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl >/dev/null 2>&1 || true; curl -s https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace | grep "^ip="'
- Non-bot (should show your normal egress):
  - docker compose run --rm --no-deps alpine sh -lc 'apk add --no-cache curl >/dev/null; curl -s https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace | grep "^ip="'

Gotchas
- If any other container uses network_mode: "service:warp", it will also be tunneled.
- If the bot exposes ports, the mappings must be on the warp service (since it owns the netns). Other services keep their own mappings unchanged.
- DNS inside the tunneled netns will follow WARP; others won’t.

**Preparing Docker integration files**

I'm setting up a new scripts/warp directory with a Dockerfile and entrypoint script, making sure the entrypoint uses bash with strict error handling and correctly manages the warp-cli commands and container persistence. I'll also update docker-compose.yml carefully to integrate this without triggering docs changes since only three files are involved. Finally, I plan to read the existing docker-compose.yml to fit the updates seamlessly.**Updating docker-compose with warp service****Creating Dockerfile****Identifying entrypoint****Preparing docker-compose.yml patch**

**Verifying Dockerfile and script changes****Analyzing entrypoint script improvements**
```

```
**Summarizing infrastructure changes involving Cloudflare WARP**

I'll wrap up by explaining the main changes related to adding the Cloudflare WARP sidecar, referencing the new Dockerfile and entrypoint script under `scripts/warp/`, along with updates to `docker-compose.yml`. I'll mention no tests were run since this is infrastructure-only, suggest running the updated compose setup for verification, and highlight next steps like checking WARP connectivity.**Cloudflare WARP**
- Added `Dockerfile` that installs Cloudflare WARP on Debian bookworm, copies the entrypoint, and wraps startup with `tini`.
- Added `entrypoint.sh` to launch `warp-svc`, register/connect in full-tunnel mode, and fail fast if the VPN can’t reach “Connected” status.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` with a `warp` sidecar (NET_ADMIN, `tun`, healthcheck) and moved the bot onto `network_mode: "service:warp"` so only it shares the VPN namespace.

Run `docker compose up -d warp bot`, then verify egress with `docker compose exec bot curl https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace | grep ^ip=`.

**Notifying of change due to failure**Updated `Dockerfile` so the build copies `entrypoint.sh` from the repo root; the previous `COPY entrypoint.sh …` path caused the compose build to fail. Re-run `docker compose up -d --build warp bot` when ready.
