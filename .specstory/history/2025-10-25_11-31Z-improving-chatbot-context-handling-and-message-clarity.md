# Improving chatbot context handling and message clarity (2025-10-25 11:31Z)

_**User (2025-10-25 11:34Z)**_

The bot interpreted its own messages as user's as well as refered to the user as itself. We need to improve the context which gets sent there for the model to clearly know its messages and user's (with name and id's). Plan comrehensive improvements.

**Planning code improvements**

I need to propose some improvements to the code so the bot doesn't confuse its messages for those of the user. Clearly defining speaker roles with specific names and IDs is essential here. I’ll outline a comprehensive plan based on the user's feedback, especially with the screenshots of the Telegram chat illustrating the confusion. Since they want a detailed plan, I might suggest specific code changes or reorganization under the app/ directory, and I should ask for clarity regarding the files in the workspace.**Outlining improvement steps**

The user has requested a plan for improvements, so I can propose specific steps along with code snippets. I should focus on robust role labeling for prompts, maintaining message history, and filtering out the bot's messages. To structure it clearly, it makes sense to use bullet points in Markdown format. 

Some key steps could be: 
1) Filter out the bot's own messages in the handler.
2) Explicitly label messages with roles (system, user, assistant).
3) Document the message format in the specified overview file. 

I also need to make sure to keep things impersonal and concise!**Updating middleware and interactions**

I'm working on several steps to improve the bot's functionality. First, I'll update the middlewares, like the ChatMetaMiddleware, to inject the bot's ID and name. For store retrieval queries, I'll use the sender ID to exclude the bot's ID, checking if the database schema needs adjustments. 

Additionally, I need to ensure that the bot's own messages are not quoted as if they're from the user. Using the aiogram API and formatting prompts for Gemini 2.5 also seems important. This will include providing a multi-message array with defined roles, capturing relevant metadata where appropriate.**Proposing a canonical conversation format**

I want to suggest adopting a canonical conversation format based on the referenced document. This would involve changing the pattern to include an explicit "turn" JSON within the initial system instruction. Alternatively, messages could be sent as "parts" using Google generative AI, ensuring there's a "sender" string for referencing IDs. Each turn should clearly state the "user" and "bot" details.

When quoting in Telegram, I'll consider the aiogram event for automatic forwarding and how messages from the bot are treated, aiming to address potential misinterpretations caused by context assembly, rather than Telegram's functioning.**Structuring the improvement plan**

I’m suggesting a series of improvements to enhance the bot's interaction quality. I'll propose adopting a canonical conversation format, ensuring messages clearly define roles. Updating the database to include a "role" column in the messages table will help achieve this. 

Key proposals include:
- Fetching and storing bot identity in context.
- Early returns for messages sent by the bot to avoid loops.
- Enhancing message normalization for clearer sender roles.
- Adding unit tests to validate that messages are correctly attributed.

I'll document these changes and recommend a verification plan, ensuring everything is well organized!Here’s a concise, end‑to‑end plan to stop the model from confusing its own messages with the user’s and to make speaker identity unambiguous.

Root cause (likely)
- Context fed to Gemini mixes bot and user messages without strict role labels.
- Quoted replies include the bot name, which the model treats as user text.
- Store/search may not preserve sender role, so retrieval returns assistant text as if it were user text.

Goals
- The model always knows: who is “assistant/bot” and who is “user”, with ids and names.
- Context builder never passes assistant text as “user”.
- Quoted/forwarded messages carry explicit roles and are summarized safely.

Plan (by layer)

1) Middleware and handler hygiene
- Inject bot identity once (id, username, display_name) via ChatMetaMiddleware.
- Guard in group handlers: if message.from_user.is_bot or message.from_user.id == bot_id → ignore; never write to context store; prevents self-loops.
- When persisting messages, save sender_id, is_bot, and sender_role = 'assistant' if from_user.id == bot_id else 'user'.

2) Data model and storage
- Ensure messages table has columns: sender_id (INT), sender_role (TEXT: 'user'|'assistant'|'system'), sender_name (TEXT). If missing, add migration in ContextStore.init().
- FTS/embedding rows should include sender_role. Index sender_role to filter fast in retrieval.
- For replies/quotes, persist reply_to_message_id and reply_to_sender_role.

3) Retrieval and context building
- In MultiLevelContextManager.build_context():
  - Retrieve conversations as structured objects with role, sender_id, sender_name, text, ts.
  - Default filter: include both roles for narrative coherence, but never reclassify roles.
  - For “active user turn” summaries, use only sender_role == 'user'.
- Add a dedicated formatter that emits Gemini messages as:
  - System: single instruction with conversation rules (do not echo metadata).
  - Messages[]: [{role: 'user'|'model', parts: [{text: ...}]}]
  - Map sender_role 'assistant' → role 'model'; 'user' → role 'user'.
  - Prepend a short, hidden header inside each part that disambiguates speakers:
    - Example first line (consumed by model, not shown to user): 
      “[speaker role=user id=123456 name=Alice]”
    - Keep it short and consistent; the persona must instruct to never repeat this to users.
- For quoted replies, add a compact inline quote block inside the same part:
  - “<quote role=model id=BOT_ID> …quoted text summary… </quote>”
  - Summarize long quotes to 1–2 sentences before insertion.

4) Prompt safety rails (system persona)
- In `persona.py` add/adjust lines:
  - You are gryag (assistant). The human user in this turn is {user_name} (id={user_id}). Do not assume you wrote user messages. Never speak the metadata tags like [speaker …] or <quote …>.
  - If text contains the bot name, treat it as mention, not authorship.
- Keep “no markdown in bot replies” constraint.

5) Filtering and de-duplication
- Strip auto-inserted “Reply to …” previews from Telegram when building model input; rely on our structured quote field instead.
- If a chunk contains the bot’s display name repeated, collapse to one instance.
- Ensure episodic/hybrid search returns both roles but the final assembly preserves roles.

6) Tests
- Unit tests (tests/unit/):
  - build_context excludes assistant text from “user-only snippets”.
  - Quote of a bot message inside a user reply is labeled quote role=model and does not flip roles.
  - Retrieval returns correct role counts and ordering.
- Integration:
  - Simulate: user → bot → user(replying to bot) → bot. Verify produced Gemini message array roles sequence: user, model, user.

7) Observability
- Add debug toggle (ENV: CONTEXT_DEBUG=1). When on, log a redacted preview of the final Gemini message array with roles and ids, not full text.
- One-shot CLI trace script under scripts/diagnostics/ to print the context for a given chat_id/message_id.

8) Rollout and migration
- Backfill sender_role for existing rows:
  - If sender_id == bot_id → assistant; else → user.
- Feature flag: ENABLE_ROLE_AWARE_CONTEXT=true (default on), with a fallback to current behavior if disabled.

9) Documentation
- Update `CURRENT_CONVERSATION_PATTERN.md` with:
  - The new [speaker …] and <quote …> conventions.
  - Mapping rules to Gemini roles.
- Add a short entry in `README.md` describing verification steps.

**Inspecting message handling files****Examining message handling and context storage****Ensuring sender role persistence in context store****Planning database schema update****Noticing required query field****Reading nearby relevant file****Reviewing message formatting functions****Enhancing message storage with sender metadata**

I'm working on adding new sender-related fields like `sender_role`, `sender_name`, and `sender_username` to the message storage without breaking existing data. This involves updating the database schema with migrations in `ContextStore.init`, modifying `add_turn` to store these fields, and adjusting `ContextStore.recent` to include them in the returned history. I also need to review how message roles are used elsewhere, especially distinguishing between user and bot roles when storing messages.**Updating message metadata handling**

I'll examine other code locations to pass new sender metadata like role and username without breaking existing calls. I need to ensure bot messages are properly excluded and adjust how context and user parts include this metadata, possibly by creating a new function to format messages before sending to Gemini. I'll locate where the final Gemini request is built by searching for the gemini client calls.**Searching for gemini_client.generate usage****Searching for Gemini calls****Inspecting request building section****Planning metadata format changes****Planning message metadata enhancement**

I'm outlining how to extend message storage with sender metadata—adding new columns, updating methods, and embedding speaker headers in message parts—to keep `GeminiClient.generate` inputs well-structured and informative.**Designing message sender metadata and headers**

I’m organizing how to expand the message data with detailed sender info and adapt the query and data structures accordingly. I’m planning to add a speaker header string to message parts, sanitize values, and keep existing role formats consistent while distinguishing sender roles and IDs, including bot IDs where relevant. I’ll also need to update related metadata formatting and persona handling in the app code.**Preparing documentation updates for new tags****Preparing documentation and tests update****Planning test updates for metadata changes**

I'm considering how the tests will need revising due to switching from `[meta]` to new `[speaker ...]` headers. I think I'll review how `format_metadata` and `format_history_compact` handle metadata and balance preserving `[meta]` for compatibility while implementing the new richer header format. This will likely involve updating test parsing logic in conversation formatter and adjusting test expectations accordingly.**Planning context metadata enhancements**

I'm weighing how to enrich message context with speaker metadata by adding a `[speaker ...]` header before `[meta]` to clarify roles and identities without a major refactor. This means updating database schemas, context storage methods, and message formatting with minimal disruption, ensuring existing tests adapt to the new dual-part header while maintaining backward compatibility.**Planning context header integration****Exploring context storage usage****Updating context handling****Detailing speaker header integration****Expanding message metadata and bot identity**

This is a big update adding detailed sender info like role, name, and username into message storage and context, plus a new `bot_identity` dict to track the bot’s info cleanly. I’m modifying DB schema, context store, handlers, and test expectations to work with new speaker headers like `[speaker role=...]`. I’ll carefully coordinate schema changes, injection of bot identity, and updates to parsing and formatting logic, including persona and docs, to support this richer message metadata while preserving compatibility and enabling better context tracing. The broad scope means I’ll plan tests and logging updates too.**Planning test updates for metadata parsing**

I’m preparing to update tests to handle the new metadata format that includes both `[speaker]` and `[meta]` parts. To keep changes minimal, I’ll adjust helper functions to inject the new header while preserving existing expected values. I’ll also search the repo for `[meta` occurrences to identify and update other modules and tests relying on the old metadata format.**Planning message schema and cleaning updates**

I'm mapping out updates to handle `[speaker]` tags in cleaning functions and text extraction to avoid leaking these in responses, plus planning schema updates to add sender info fields to the messages table while keeping inserts consistent. I’ll proceed carefully to stage these changes step-by-step.
```

```
**Planning extensive ContextStore updates**

I'm mapping out how to extend `ContextStore` to handle detailed sender info—adding new columns, sanitizing inputs, updating DB schema and methods like `add_turn` and `recent` to track roles, names, usernames, and bot flags, plus creating a helper to format speaker headers cleanly for message history. This will involve careful insertion and retrieval to keep metadata consistent and avoid duplication.

**Planning to restore original file content**

I'm noticing the error messages still point to the old corrupted code before the new function, meaning the earlier problematic block wasn't fully removed. I think it’s best to get the original clean version of the file from the last commit via git and then carefully reapply the changes. I plan to use a terminal command to retrieve the `app/services/context_store.py` file as it was at HEAD so I can start fresh and avoid lingering bugs from partial edits.**Planning file reset and patching****Reopening file to confirm baseline****Preparing schema and helper additions**

```
**Analyzing lint error and planning schema update**

I'm noticing a lint error about a "None" object not being subscriptable in existing code, possibly triggered indirectly by recent changes. I decide to set this aside for now and focus on updating the `init` function to add checks and alter statements for new database columns. This way, I can ensure schema updates are applied properly after the current modifications.

I’m making sure the current user message sent to the model includes a speaker header to align with stored history formatting. This involves inserting the header before metadata in immediate message parts and updating imports to bring in `format_speaker_header`.
