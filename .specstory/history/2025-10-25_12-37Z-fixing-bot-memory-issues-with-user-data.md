I’m noticing a critical flaw in `app/services/monitoring/continuous_monitor.py` lines 466-517 where `_extract_facts_from_window` passes the entire multi-user conversation as the `message` parameter to `fact_extractor.extract_facts` for each user. This causes fact extractors—especially the LLM fallback—to attribute statements from all participants to every user, resulting in inaccurate, junk facts. The bug stems from not filtering messages per user before extraction; ideally, only lines spoken by the target user should be provided as `message`, with the rest optionally passed as `context`. Also, `user_names` only holds generic `User{id}` placeholders, further reducing clarity. Additionally, fallback to the Gemini extractor triggers whenever there are fewer than two facts and long messages, amplifying hallucinations because of the undifferentiated conversation. I’m compiling bullet points referencing the file and lines to highlight these key findings without offering direct fixes, focusing on the aggregator’s problematic design and how filtering per user would resolve the root cause.**Major Bug**
- `continuous_monitor.py` (≈466-525): `_extract_facts_from_window` builds a single `conversation` string containing every speaker’s messages and then, for *each* user in the window, calls `fact_extractor.extract_facts(message=conversation, user_id=user_id, ...)`. Inside the Gemini-backed extractor the prompt says “Current message from user @{username}: …”, so every participant is treated as if they authored the entire window (including lines that belong to other people). When the rule-based tier can’t confirm ≥2 hits, the fallback LLM happily “extracts” dozens of invented facts and we persist them via the unified fact repository. This is the source of the junk memories like “preferred_imagery Donald Trump & Obama”. Fix: only pass that user’s own utterances as the `message` (e.g. join the user’s recent lines), and if wider context is needed, feed the *other* lines through the `context` argument or annotate them with speaker metadata. After scoping the input per user, the fact extractor stops hallucinating cross-user facts.

**Residual Risk**
- Until the per-user scoping is corrected, any conversation window will continue to contaminate memory with hallucinated “facts”, and the validator pipeline can’t undo it because the fabricated entries look “valid”. I’d scrub the existing bad rows once the extractor is fixed.

Let's **only** rely on Gemini's judgement and tool calling and remove those continuous monitoring legacy code, and fix the context

_**Assistant (copilot/gpt-5-codex)**_

**Preparing to remove continuous monitoring features****Planning removal of continuous monitor and fact extractor**

I'm mapping out how to remove the legacy continuous monitoring code, especially disabling or removing fact extraction auto-updates in chat.py and stopping ContinuousMonitor initialization and middleware injection in main.py and chat_meta.py. I’m also considering whether to fix context passing bugs related to the extractor or simply avoid calling it given the switch to Gemini judgment and tool usage only. I'll check for other uses of `fact_extractor` to avoid breaking anything else.**Analyzing fact_extractor usage****Evaluating auto extraction removal****Searching for _update_user_profile_background calls****Preparing to remove continuous monitor and fact extractor****Considering removal of middleware features****Planning removal of continuous monitor****Removing fact_extractor and continuous monitoring code**

I'll remove the `fact_extractor` parameter and all related continuous monitoring code, cleaning imports and calls in `chat.py`, `main.py`, and middleware. I'll carefully update context handling to avoid relying on removed features and ensure conversation history and user profile updates stay consistent without legacy dependencies.**Preparing to remove components****Preparing removal of continuous_monitor and fact_extractor references****Evaluating configuration cleanup****Refactoring to remove fact_extractor and simplify user profile updates**

I'm preparing to remove all references to `fact_extractor` and related continuous monitor code across multiple modules, updating function signatures, imports, and calls accordingly. I'll simplify `_update_user_profile_background` to focus only on profile creation and interaction updates without extraction, carefully trimming unused parameters like `history` and `user_message` to keep things clean and consistent.

I’m setting up missing globals like a recent context dictionary with a 5-minute TTL and defining helper functions to detect image edit and generation requests based on keywords in multiple languages. I’ll also plan to simplify user profile background updates while checking related store interfaces to confirm available methods.**Preparing to refactor chat.py functions****Investigating profile update methods****Searching for update_profile method****Searching for get_or_create_profile method****Planning user profile updates****Planning patch for corrupted docstring fix**

**Tidying keyword lists and updating user profile background**

I’m reviewing duplicate entries in the keyword lists to clean them up later and checking type imports to ensure annotations work smoothly. Now, I’m focusing on rewriting `_update_user_profile_background` to remove unused parameters and align it with the updated call signature, handling profile updates safely with error logging.

**Verifying type imports and variable definitions****Reviewing imports and logging strategy**

I'm checking that all necessary imports like `deque` are properly included, deciding how to handle debug logging for tool-based memory without overwhelming logs, and ensuring that removed types like `FactExtractor` aren't lingering in the code. Also, I'll tidy import order to keep it readable and PEP 8 compliant, especially moving `logging` before typing imports.

**Diagnosing PYTHON bytecode write error****Testing bytecode-free compilation****Verifying code cleanup and refactoring****Preparing final modification summary**- Rebuilt the helper section near the top of `chat.py`, restoring `_get_response`, the recent-context cache constants, username normalizer, and the image request heuristics that had been mangled in the previous edit.
- Simplified `_update_user_profile_background` so it only ensures the profile exists and bumps the interaction counters, matching the new Gemini-only memory flow and aligning with its call site.
- Added a debug trace when tool-based memory is active and verified the file compiles by running an in-memory `compile()` check with `python`.

- Tests not run (not requested).

Next step: consider `.venv/bin/pytest tests/` to make sure the handler changes behave as expected end-to-end.

```

```
**Preparing to run targeted tests****Summarizing fix and tests**- Restored the metadata-cleaning regex constants (`_META_PREFIX_RE`, `_META_ANYWHERE_RE`, `_TECHNICAL_INFO_RE`) near the top of `chat.py`, so `_clean_response_text` once again strips Gemini meta markers and technical IDs without NameErrors.
- Confirmed the fix by running `/home/thathunky/gryag/.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_response_cleaning.py`.

Consider running the full suite (`pytest`) when you’re ready to ensure no other regressions linger.

#terminalSelection fix this crap, it shouldn't be **REDACTED PHONE**! It's a damn user id!

_**Assistant (copilot/gpt-5-codex)**_

**Investigating redacted output issue****Searching for redacted phone key****Searching for redacted strings in logs****Investigating multi_level_context redaction function****Investigating redacted phone formatting****Inspecting speaker header formatting****Testing sanitized text regex issue****Designing refined phone redaction**

This is a detailed exploration to improve phone number redaction by skipping numbers that appear as user IDs or inside metadata like `id=` or `user_id=`. I’m considering replacing the current regex with a function-based approach that checks the surrounding text to decide whether to redact, aiming to preserve user IDs while still masking phone numbers reliably. I'll also want to add tests to cover these cases and avoid unintended redactions.**Searching for tests on sanitized text****Locating test file for new unit test****Opening test_placeholder_sanitization file****Evaluating test placement****Planning text sanitization improvements**

I'll modify the `_sanitize_text` function to redact phone numbers except when preceded

---

_**User (2025-10-25 13:31Z)**_

Let's NOT redact personal info! Why??

---

_**Assistant (copilot/gpt-5-codex)**_

**Preparing privacy-focused response**Redaction is there so logs can’t leak personal data when Gemini context gets replayed or pasted elsewhere. If you prefer to keep raw numbers, we can relax `_sanitize_text` in `multi_level_context.py` (it’s the bit swapping phone-like strings with `[redacted_phone]`). Just keep in mind the bot will then ship whatever IDs/phones it sees straight into Gemini prompts and log output, so double-check downstream policies before switching it off.

If you want me to remove that guard, let me know and we’ll adjust the pattern or drop it entirely.

_**User (2025-10-25 13:32Z)**_

Remove that guard

---

_**Assistant (copilot/gpt-5-codex)**_

**Updating sanitizer to keep phone numbers**
```

```
**Verifying comments and test coverage**- Updated `multi_level_context.py` so `_sanitize_text` no longer swaps phone-like strings for `[redacted_phone]`, keeping numeric user IDs intact while documenting why the filter was removed.

Tests not run (let me know if you want me to kick off `pytest`).

---

_**User (2025-10-25 13:35Z)**_

What else gets redacted?

---

_**Assistant (copilot/gpt-5-codex)**_

**Identifying redaction logic across code**- `_sanitize_text` in `multi_level_context.py` still strips emails (replaces them with `[redacted_email]`), drops debug-style prefixes like `debug:`/`trace:`, and collapses whitespace.
- `_sanitize_message` then removes internal keys such as `provenance`, `metadata`, `debug_info`, etc., and runs `_sanitize_text` over every text field and part of the message.
- On the reply path, `_clean_response_text` in `chat.py` wipes any `[meta …]` blocks, technical IDs (`chat_id=…`, `user_id=…`, `request_id=…`, etc.), and Gemini’s bracketed markers (`[GENERATED_IMAGE]`, `[ATTACHMENT]`, etc.) before the reply goes back to Telegram.
- Placeholder scrubbers (`sanitize_placeholder_text` and `_format_for_telegram`) also remove `TGFMT*`/`RAW*` artifacts so Gemini private markers don’t leak to chat.

With the phone-number guard gone, everything else above continues to sanitize as before.
