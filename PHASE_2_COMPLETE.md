# Phase 2: Fact Quality Management - Implementation Complete

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Completion Date**: 2024  
**Lines Added**: ~530 lines (fact_quality_manager.py expanded from 70 to 600 lines)

## Summary

Phase 2 implements intelligent fact quality management through semantic deduplication, conflict resolution, and confidence decay. This transforms the raw fact stream into a high-quality, consistent knowledge base.

## Components Implemented

### FactQualityManager (`app/services/monitoring/fact_quality_manager.py`)

Complete implementation with ~600 lines providing:

#### 1. Semantic Deduplication (Task 8)
**Purpose**: Eliminate duplicate facts using embedding similarity
**Implementation**:
- Generates embeddings via Gemini API (`text-embedding-004`)
- Rate-limited to 5 concurrent calls with 1-second minimum interval
- Compares facts using cosine similarity (0.85+ = duplicate)
- Falls back to simple key-based comparison if embeddings unavailable
- Merges duplicates in-place, boosting confidence by 10%

**Key Code**:
```python
async def deduplicate_facts(self, facts: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Generate embeddings for each fact
    embeddings = await self._get_embeddings([f["fact"] for f in facts])
    
    # Find duplicates using cosine similarity
    for i, fact_a in enumerate(facts):
        for j, fact_b in enumerate(facts[i+1:], start=i+1):
            similarity = self._cosine_similarity(embeddings[i], embeddings[j])
            if similarity >= 0.85:  # Duplicate threshold
                # Merge facts, boost confidence
                self._merge_facts(fact_a, fact_b)
```

**Parameters**:
- `DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD = 0.85`: Cosine similarity for duplicates
- `CONFIDENCE_BOOST = 0.10`: Boost when merging duplicates
- `embedding_semaphore`: Limit to 5 concurrent API calls
- `last_embedding_time`: Ensure 1-second minimum interval

**Metrics Logged**:
- `total_duplicates_removed`: Number of duplicate facts merged
- Processing time

#### 2. Conflict Resolution (Task 9)
**Purpose**: Intelligently resolve contradictory facts
**Implementation**:
- Identifies conflicts using 0.70-0.85 similarity range
- Scores each fact using weighted criteria:
  - **Confidence** (40%): Trust more confident sources
  - **Recency** (30%): Prefer newer information
  - **Detail** (20%): More detailed facts win
  - **Source reliability** (10%): Addressed messages > casual chatter
- Keeps highest-scoring fact, marks others as superseded

**Key Code**:
```python
def resolve_conflicts(self, facts: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    conflicts = []
    for i, fact_a in enumerate(facts):
        for j, fact_b in enumerate(facts[i+1:], start=i+1):
            if 0.70 <= similarity < 0.85:  # Conflict range
                conflicts.append(FactComparison(i, j, similarity))
    
    for conflict in conflicts:
        score_a = self._score_fact(facts[conflict.idx_a])
        score_b = self._score_fact(facts[conflict.idx_b])
        
        if score_a > score_b:
            facts[conflict.idx_b]["superseded"] = True
        else:
            facts[conflict.idx_a]["superseded"] = True
```

**Scoring Formula**:
```
score = (confidence * 0.40) + 
        (recency_score * 0.30) + 
        (detail_score * 0.20) + 
        (source_score * 0.10)
```

**Metrics Logged**:
- `conflicts_resolved`: Number of conflicting facts resolved
- Conflict resolution details (winning fact, scores)

#### 3. Confidence Decay (Task 10)
**Purpose**: Automatically reduce confidence in old facts
**Implementation**:
- Exponential decay with 90-day half-life
- Minimum confidence floor of 0.1 (facts never fully disappear)
- Applied during quality processing pipeline

**Key Code**:
```python
def apply_confidence_decay(self, facts: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    now = datetime.now()
    half_life_days = 90
    decay_constant = math.log(2) / half_life_days
    
    for fact in facts:
        age_days = (now - fact["timestamp"]).days
        decay_factor = math.exp(-decay_constant * age_days)
        
        # Apply decay with minimum floor
        original = fact["confidence"]
        fact["confidence"] = max(0.1, original * decay_factor)
```

**Parameters**:
- `HALF_LIFE_DAYS = 90`: Time for confidence to halve
- `MIN_CONFIDENCE = 0.1`: Never drop below this
- Formula: `confidence = max(0.1, original * e^(-ln(2)/90 * days))`

**Metrics Logged**:
- `facts_decayed`: Number of facts with reduced confidence
- Average decay amount

#### 4. Quality Pipeline
**Purpose**: Orchestrate all quality improvements
**Implementation**:
```python
async def process_facts(self, facts: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    if not facts:
        return []
    
    # Validate fact structure
    facts = self.validate_facts(facts)
    
    # Remove duplicates
    facts = await self.deduplicate_facts(facts)
    
    # Resolve conflicts
    facts = self.resolve_conflicts(facts)
    
    # Apply confidence decay
    facts = self.apply_confidence_decay(facts)
    
    # Log metrics
    await self._log_quality_metrics(...)
    
    return [f for f in facts if not f.get("superseded")]
```

## Integration Points

### ContinuousMonitor Integration
**File**: `app/services/monitoring/continuous_monitor.py`
**Changes**:
```python
self.fact_quality_manager = FactQualityManager(
    gemini_client=gemini_client,      # For embeddings
    db_connection=context_store,      # For metrics logging
)
```

**Usage** (will be in Phase 3):
```python
async def _store_facts(self, window_id: int, facts: List[Dict]):
    # Apply quality processing before storage
    cleaned_facts = await self.fact_quality_manager.process_facts(facts)
    
    # Store cleaned facts in database
    for fact in cleaned_facts:
        await self.context_store.store_fact(fact)
```

## Database Changes

### fact_quality_metrics Table
Already created in Phase 1, now actively used:
```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_quality_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    window_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    total_facts INTEGER NOT NULL,
    duplicates_removed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    conflicts_resolved INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    facts_decayed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    processing_time_ms INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (window_id) REFERENCES conversation_windows(id)
);
```

**Logged Metrics**:
- Total facts processed per window
- Duplicates removed (semantic + key-based)
- Conflicts resolved (with conflict details in JSON)
- Facts decayed (confidence reduced due to age)
- Processing time in milliseconds

## Configuration (No Changes)

All configuration already added in Phase 1. Relevant settings:
```python
# No new settings - reuses Phase 1 config
enable_continuous_monitoring: bool = True
```

FactQualityManager respects the master switch but has no per-component toggle (always runs when facts are processed).

## Performance Characteristics

### Embedding Generation
- **Rate Limit**: 5 concurrent requests, 1-second minimum interval
- **Model**: `text-embedding-004` (768 dimensions)
- **Fallback**: Simple key-based deduplication if API unavailable
- **Expected Load**: ~10-50 embeddings per window (Phase 3)

### Processing Time
- **Validation**: O(n) - check all facts
- **Deduplication**: O(n²) - pairwise comparisons (acceptable for small batches)
- **Conflict Resolution**: O(n²) - same as deduplication
- **Decay**: O(n) - apply formula to each fact
- **Total**: O(n²) worst case, dominated by embedding API calls

**Expected**: 1-3 seconds for typical window (8 messages, 5-15 facts)

### Memory Usage
- **Embeddings**: 768 floats × 50 facts = ~150KB per batch
- **Facts**: ~1-2KB each × 50 = ~50-100KB per batch
- **Total**: <1MB per window processing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Recommended)
```bash
# Test deduplication
python -c "from app.services.monitoring.fact_quality_manager import FactQualityManager; ..."

# Test conflict resolution with known conflicts
# Test decay calculations with different ages
# Test validation with malformed facts
```

### Integration Tests
1. **Deduplication Test**:
   - Create 2 facts with identical meaning but different wording
   - Run through `deduplicate_facts()`
   - Verify only 1 fact remains with boosted confidence

2. **Conflict Resolution Test**:
   - Create 2 facts with conflicting information
   - Run through `resolve_conflicts()`
   - Verify higher-scored fact kept, lower marked superseded

3. **Decay Test**:
   - Create fact with timestamp 180 days ago
   - Run through `apply_confidence_decay()`
   - Verify confidence reduced by ~75% (two half-lives)

4. **Pipeline Test**:
   - Create batch with duplicates, conflicts, old facts
   - Run through `process_facts()`
   - Verify all quality improvements applied

### Production Monitoring
Once Phase 3 enables fact extraction:
```sql
-- Monitor deduplication effectiveness
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    AVG(duplicates_removed * 100.0 / total_facts) as dup_rate_pct,
    AVG(conflicts_resolved * 100.0 / total_facts) as conflict_rate_pct
FROM fact_quality_metrics
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 7;

-- Check processing performance
SELECT 
    AVG(processing_time_ms) as avg_ms,
    MAX(processing_time_ms) as max_ms,
    COUNT(*) as windows_processed
FROM fact_quality_metrics
WHERE created_at > datetime('now', '-1 hour');
```

## Expected Impact

Based on IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_SUMMARY.md projections:

### Fact Quality Improvements
- **Duplicates**: Reduce from ~5% to <1% of facts
- **Conflicts**: Resolve 2-3% of facts that would otherwise conflict
- **Freshness**: Gradually phase out stale information (90-day half-life)
- **Overall Quality**: 3-5x improvement in fact reliability

### Before Phase 2
```
Raw Facts → Storage
- 5% duplicates stored
- Conflicting facts both kept
- Old facts never decay
- Quality issues compound over time
```

### After Phase 2
```
Raw Facts → Quality Processing → Storage
- <1% duplicates (merged with confidence boost)
- Conflicts resolved (best fact kept)
- Old facts gradually decay
- High-quality knowledge base maintained
```

## Phase 2 Completion Checklist

- ✅ Semantic deduplication implemented
- ✅ Embedding generation with rate limiting
- ✅ Cosine similarity comparison
- ✅ Duplicate merging with confidence boost
- ✅ Conflict detection (0.70-0.85 range)
- ✅ Weighted conflict scoring (4 factors)

- ✅ Exponential confidence decay (90-day half-life)
- ✅ Validation pipeline
- ✅ Quality metrics logging
- ✅ Integration with ContinuousMonitor
- ✅ Statistics tracking
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks

## Next Steps: Phase 3

Phase 3 will **activate** the continuous learning system:

1. **Enable Message Filtering** (Task 11):
   - Set `enable_message_filtering = True`
   - Actually filter LOW/NOISE messages (currently just logging)
   - Expected: 40-60% reduction in processed messages

2. **Start Async Workers** (Task 12):
   - Set `enable_async_processing = True`
   - Start 3 background workers to process event queue
   - Messages processed asynchronously without blocking handlers

3. **Enable Window Analysis** (Task 13):
   - Implement `_extract_facts_from_window()` in ContinuousMonitor
   - Implement `_store_facts()` with FactQualityManager integration
   - Start learning from **all** conversation windows (not just addressed messages)

Phase 3 is where the system transitions from **logging** to **acting** - this is the big behavior change that will increase learning from 5-10% to 80%+ of messages.

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **Phase 2 Changes**: All changes are in FactQualityManager, not yet called by any active code
- **Integration**: ContinuousMonitor passes dependencies but doesn't call `process_facts()` yet
- **Behavior**: Zero change to bot behavior (facts not extracted from windows until Phase 3)

### Medium Risk (Phase 3)
- Message filtering will change what gets processed
- Async processing introduces concurrency
- Window-based learning is new code path

### Mitigation
- Gradual rollout: Filter → Async → Learning
- Circuit breakers in place from Phase 1
- Can disable via `enable_continuous_monitoring = False`
- Quality metrics provide visibility into issues
