# Phase 4 Planning Complete - Summary

**Created**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation  
**Document**: `PHASE_4_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Overview

Phase 4 transforms gryag from a **reactive** bot (answers when addressed) to a **proactive** bot (joins conversations naturally when it can add value). This is the most user-visible change and requires careful implementation to avoid being intrusive.

## What Phase 4 Adds

### Core Capabilities
1. **Intent Classification**: Detects when bot should respond
   - Question detection (unanswered queries)
   - Request detection (information needs)
   - Problem detection (issues bot can solve)
   - Opportunity detection (relevant info to share)

2. **User Preference Learning**: Adapts per-user
   - Tracks reactions (positive, neutral, negative, ignored)
   - Adjusts proactivity multiplier (0.0-2.0x)
   - Backs off after consecutive ignores
   - Respects negative feedback

3. **Response Triggers**: Safe decision logic
   - Multiple cooldowns (5min global, 10min per-user, 30min per-intent)
   - Rate limits (6/hour, 40/day)
   - Safety checks (window size, recency, confidence)
   - Conservative by default

## Architecture

### New Components
- `IntentClassifier` - Uses Gemini to detect response opportunities
- `UserPreferenceManager` - Learns and enforces user preferences
- `ResponseTrigger` - Main decision logic with safety checks
- `ProactiveResponse` - Decision dataclass with justification

### Database Changes
```sql
-- New table
CREATE TABLE proactive_responses (
    id, chat_id, user_id, window_id,
    intent_type, confidence, response_text,
    reaction, reaction_time_seconds, sent_at
);
```

### Configuration (20+ new settings)
- `ENABLE_PROACTIVE_RESPONSES` (master switch, default: false)
- Confidence thresholds (0.7 minimum)
- Cooldowns (5-30 minutes)
- Rate limits (6/hour, 40/day)
- Safety parameters

## Implementation Plan

### Task 16: Intent Classification (~400 lines)
- Build `IntentClassifier` class
- Implement Gemini-based intent detection
- Parse JSON responses with confidence scores
- Cache results per window
- **Estimated**: 3-4 hours

### Task 17: User Preference Learning (~350 lines)
- Build `UserPreferenceManager` class
- Track reactions in database
- Calculate proactivity multipliers
- Enforce cooldowns (global, per-user, per-intent)
- **Estimated**: 3-4 hours

### Task 18: Response Trigger Logic (~400 lines)
- Extend `ProactiveTrigger` with decision logic
- Implement 8 safety checks
- Rate limit enforcement
- Integration with ContinuousMonitor
- **Estimated**: 4-5 hours

### Task 19: Testing & Documentation (~2-3 hours)
- Create testing guide with 5 test scenarios
- Document tuning parameters
- Write rollout plan
- **Estimated**: 2-3 hours

**Total Estimated Effort**: 12-15 hours

## Testing Strategy

### 5 Test Scenarios
1. **Intent Detection Accuracy** - >90% precision required
2. **Cooldown Enforcement** - Verify 5-30 min gaps
3. **User Preference Learning** - Adapt after 3 ignores
4. **Rate Limits** - Block at 6/hour, 40/day
5. **Safety Checks** - All 8 checks must work

### Success Metrics
- Intent precision: >90%
- False positives: <10%
- User satisfaction: >70% positive/neutral
- Spam instances: 0 (>3 consecutive)

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 4.1: Implementation (Week 5)
- Implement all 3 core classes
- Add database migration
- Integrate with ContinuousMonitor

### Phase 4.2: Testing (Week 5)
- Run all 5 test scenarios
- Tune confidence thresholds
- Validate safety mechanisms

### Phase 4.3: Soft Launch (Week 6)
- Enable in single test chat
- Monitor for 48 hours
- Track response rate (1-2/hour target)

### Phase 4.4: Production (Week 6)
- Enable globally after validation
- Monitor stats dashboard
- Collect user feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Bot Becomes Annoying
**Mitigation**:
- Very conservative thresholds (70% confidence)
- Multiple cooldowns (3 types)
- User preference learning
- Easy disable switch

### Risk: Intent Inaccuracy
**Mitigation**:
- Extensive testing
- Tunable thresholds
- Fallback to silence
- Comprehensive logging

### Risk: Performance Impact
**Mitigation**:
- Only on window close (not every message)
- Async processing via event queue
- Cached classifications
- Rate limits prevent runaway

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Conservative by Default**: Better to stay silent than spam
   - 70% confidence minimum (high bar)
   - Multiple cooldowns (5-30 minutes)
   - Rate limits (6/hour)

2. **User-Adaptive**: Learn preferences per user
   - Track reactions automatically
   - Adjust confidence (0.0-2.0x multiplier)
   - Back off after ignores

3. **Safety-First**: Multiple safety checks
   - 8 safety checks before responding
   - Circuit breakers for failures
   - Easy rollback (config flag)

4. **Transparent**: Log all decisions
   - Log intent detection
   - Log why responses blocked
   - Track stats for tuning

## Example Flow

```
Window closes (8 messages, 3 participants)
  ↓
Check: ENABLE_PROACTIVE_RESPONSES? ✅
  ↓
Check: Window size >= 3? ✅
  ↓
Check: Recent activity (<3 min)? ✅
  ↓
Classify Intent: "question" (confidence: 0.85) ✅
  ↓
Check: Global cooldown (5 min)? ✅
  ↓
Check: Rate limits (6/hour, 40/day)? ✅
  ↓
Get User Preference: multiplier=1.0 ✅
  ↓
Adjusted Confidence: 0.85 * 1.0 = 0.85 ✅
  ↓
Check: Confidence >= 0.7? ✅
  ↓
RESPOND PROACTIVELY ✅
  ↓
Generate response via Gemini
  ↓
Send to chat
  ↓
Record in database
  ↓
Track user reaction (in next window)
```

## What's Next

### Immediate (Now)
- Review Phase 4 plan
- Decide: Implement Phase 4 OR Test Phase 3 first

### After Phase 4 (Week 7+)
- Phase 5: Optimization (caching, batching, resource tuning)
- Phase 6: Advanced features (threading, emotion, personalization)

## Progress Summary

**Overall Progress**: 15/19 tasks complete (79%)

**Completed**:
- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (7 tasks, 1,470 lines)
- ✅ Phase 2: Quality (3 tasks, 600 lines)
- ✅ Phase 3: Continuous Learning (4 tasks, 170 lines)
- ✅ Phase 4: Planning (1 task)

**Remaining**:
- ⏳ Phase 4: Implementation (3 tasks, ~1,150 lines estimated)
- ⏳ Phase 4: Testing (1 task)

## Files Created

1. `PHASE_4_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (1,150 lines)
   - Complete architecture documentation
   - Detailed implementation for all 3 classes
   - Testing strategy with 5 scenarios
   - Rollout plan with phases
   - Risk mitigation strategies

2. Previous Deliverables:
   - `PHASE_3_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (testing/activation guide)
   - `PHASE_3_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (Phase 3 documentation)
   - `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` (Phase 2 summary)
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (Phase 1 summary)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Phase 4 is high-value but high-risk**: Changes user-facing behavior significantly

2. **Safety is paramount**: Multiple layers of protection against spam

3. **User adaptation is crucial**: One size doesn't fit all - learn preferences

4. **Testing is extensive**: 5 test scenarios with specific success criteria

5. **Rollout is staged**: Soft launch → tuning → production

6. **Easy rollback**: Single config flag to disable (`ENABLE_PROACTIVE_RESPONSES=false`)

## Recommendation

**Option A**: Test Phase 3 first
- Validate continuous learning works
- Ensure quality processing effective
- Confirm resource usage acceptable
- **Then** implement Phase 4

**Option B**: Implement Phase 4 now
- Phase 3 implementation complete
- Safe defaults prevent activation
- Can test both together
- Faster to "feature complete"

**My Recommendation**: **Option A** - Test Phase 3 first. Ensures solid foundation before adding proactive responses.
