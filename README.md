# Gryag Bot (V2)
**Status: Start from Scratch / Architecture Phase**

This repository is currently undergoing a full rewrite. The legacy codebase for the original Telegram bot has been moved to the [`legacy`](https://github.com/ThatHunky/gryag/tree/legacy) branch.

## Project Vision 
Gryag is a conversational AI bot for Telegram, originally powered by Gemini Flash 2.5. It was designed to have a strong, distinct character—providing sharp, witty, and deeply Ukrainian responses while remembering context and learning about users.

The goal of this new version is to rebuild the bot from scratch, keeping its core **idea** but potentially improving its foundation and architecture.

## Legacy Capabilities
For a detailed breakdown of the features, architectural principles, and the advanced context system of the previous bot, see:
👉 [**bot_architecture_and_capabilities.md**](./bot_architecture_and_capabilities.md)

### Key Ideals to Retain
- **Character & Persona**: Sharp, sarcastic, zero-filter Ukrainian persona.
- **Deep Contextual Awareness**: Remembering user facts, identifying episodes, and reducing redundant API calls through local/hybrid context strategies.
- **Cost Optimization**: Complex token-saving mechanics and intelligent routing between Gemini API and OpenAI API. 

## Development
(Instructions for the new V2 setup will go here as development begins).
