docs/guides/

- TOOL_LOGGING_GUIDE.md
- PHASE_3_TESTING_GUIDE.md

docs/history/

- (moved .specstory history files)

docs/other/

- IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
- USER_PROFILING_STATUS.md

Verification steps (manual):

1. Confirm files exist under `docs/`:

   grep -n "#" docs -R | head -n 10

2. Quick git sanity check (should show renames):

   git log --name-status --pretty="%h %ad %s" --date=short | head -n 40

3. Optional tests (if you can run the environment):

   python -m pytest -q

Notes:

- Relative links inside moved files may need updating; run a link-checker or `grep -R "(.md)" docs` to find internal references.
- If you prefer `git mv` for some files that were moved outside of git, follow up with `git mv <src> <dest>` to preserve history; most files were moved with `git mv` in this change.
