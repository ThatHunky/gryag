This ## Recent Changes

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Admin Commands (Phase 5 Complete) ðŸŽ‰** - Implemented full admin interface for chat memory management. Created `/gryadchatfacts` command (shows facts grouped by category with confidence bars) and `/gryadchatreset` command (delete all chat facts with confirmation). Added `chat_admin_router` with emoji formatting and admin-only access control. **Chat Public Memory System is now FULLY OPERATIONAL** - all 5 phases complete! Verification: `test -f app/handlers/chat_admin.py && echo "âœ…"` 

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Initialization (Phase 4 Complete)** - Wired chat public memory into bot startup sequence. ChatProfileRepository now initializes on startup and gets injected into ContinuousMonitor (creates ChatFactExtractor internally) and ChatMetaMiddleware (makes it available to all handlers). Implemented abstract methods in ChatProfileRepository (find_by_id, save, delete). Next: create admin commands for chat fact management. Verification: `grep -c "chat_profile_store" app/main.py app/middlewares/chat_meta.py` (should show 6+ matches)

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Integration (Phase 3 Complete)** - Integrated chat-level memory extraction and retrieval into the continuous monitoring pipeline and multi-level context system. Added `raw_messages` field to `ConversationWindow`, implemented `_store_chat_facts()` in ContinuousMonitor, extended `BackgroundContext` with chat facts. Token budget: 60% user facts (720 tokens), 40% chat facts (480 tokens). Modified 3 core files: `continuous_monitor.py`, `conversation_analyzer.py`, `multi_level_context.py`. Next: initialize in main.py, create admin commands. See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (2025-10-08 entry). Verification: `bash scripts/verification/verify_chat_memory_integration.sh` (33/37 checks passing)der contains the repository documentation organized into subfolders. When moving or reorganizing docs, follow the rules in `AGENTS.md` and add a short summary here describing the change.

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Integration (Phase 3 Complete)** - Integrated chat-level memory system into continuous monitoring and multi-level context pipelines. Added `raw_messages` field to `ConversationWindow`, implemented `_store_chat_facts()` in ContinuousMonitor, extended `BackgroundContext` with chat facts. Token budget: 60% user facts (720 tokens), 40% chat facts (480 tokens). Modified 3 core files: `continuous_monitor.py`, `conversation_analyzer.py`, `multi_level_context.py`. Next: initialize in main.py, create admin commands. See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (2025-10-08 entry). Verification: `bash scripts/verification/verify_chat_memory_integration.sh` (33/37 checks passing)

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Plan** - Created comprehensive design plan for group-level memory system. Bot will now remember chat-wide facts (preferences, traditions, rules, culture) separate from user-specific facts. Includes: new database schema (`chat_facts` table), extraction methods (pattern, statistical, LLM), integration with multi-level context, and token budget management (400 tokens max). 4-week implementation roadmap. See `docs/plans/CHAT_PUBLIC_MEMORY.md`. Verification: `grep -c "chat_facts\|ChatFactExtractor\|chat_profile" docs/plans/CHAT_PUBLIC_MEMORY.md` (should show 50+ matches)

**October 8, 2025**: **Repository Cleanup and Organization** - Organized root-level files into proper directories. Moved 3 markdown docs to `docs/`, 19 Python scripts to `scripts/` (organized into migrations/, diagnostics/, tests/, verification/, deprecated/), and 6 shell scripts to `scripts/verification/`. Created `scripts/README.md` with comprehensive inventory. Only `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` remain at root. See changelog entry below. Verification: `ls -1 *.py *.sh *.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v -E "^(README.md|AGENTS.md)$"` (should return empty) and `tree scripts/ -L 1` (should show organized subdirectories)

**October 8, 2025**: **Google Search Grounding SDK Compatibility Fix** - Attempted to modernize to `google_search` format but discovered bot uses legacy `google.generativeai` SDK which only supports `google_search_retrieval`. Reverted to working configuration with detailed documentation. Error: `ValueError: Unknown field for FunctionDeclaration: google_search`. Modified `app/handlers/chat.py` (reverted with explanatory comment), updated docs. See `docs/fixes/SEARCH_GROUNDING_API_UPDATE.md`. Verification: `grep "google_search_retrieval" app/handlers/chat.py` (should find the working format)

# Documentation Index

Recent significant changes:

1. **2025-01-29**: [Google Gemini SDK Migration](fixes/SEARCH_GROUNDING_SDK_MIGRATION.md) - Migrated from `google-generativeai` 0.8.5 to `google-genai` 0.2+ for native Gemini 2.5 support
2. **2025-10-08**: [Reply Message Media Visibility Fix](fixes/REPLY_MEDIA_VISIBILITY_FIX.md) - Fixed media context in replies (was being silently dropped)

**October 7, 2025**: Implemented **Comprehensive Model Capability Detection System** - Bot now automatically adapts to different Gemini model families (Gemma, Gemini, Flash) by detecting and gracefully handling: audio support, video support, media count limits, function calling (tools), rate limiting, and historical context filtering. Five fixes in total: (1) media count limiting (max 28 for Gemma), (2) current message media filtering by type, (3) historical context two-phase filtering, (4) rate limit warnings, (5) tool support detection and disabling. Works with zero configuration - just set `GEMINI_MODEL` and capabilities are auto-detected. See `docs/features/comprehensive-model-capability-detection.md` and 5 detailed fix docs in `docs/fixes/` and `docs/features/`. Verification: `grep -E "_detect.*support|_is_media_supported|_limit_media_in_history" app/services/gemini.py app/services/context/multi_level_context.py | wc -l` (should show 15+ matches)

**October 7, 2025**: Completed **Phase 2: Universal Bot Configuration** - Bot now supports multiple deployments with different identities. Added dynamic command prefixes (17 commands support both `/gryag*` and `/{prefix}*`), chat filter middleware (whitelist/blacklist modes), configurable trigger patterns, Redis namespace isolation, and `/chatinfo` command. All configurable via `.env` without code changes. See `docs/phases/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md`. Verification: `grep -r "ChatFilterMiddleware\|initialize_triggers\|chatinfo_command" app/ | wc -l` (should show 5+ matches)

**October 7, 2025**: Added **System Prompt Management** feature - admins can now customize bot personality via Telegram commands. Created `SystemPromptManager` service with database persistence, version history, and rollback. New commands: `/gryagprompt`, `/gryagsetprompt`, `/gryagresetprompt`, `/gryagprompthistory`, `/gryagactivateprompt`. Supports global and chat-specific prompts with file upload. See `docs/features/SYSTEM_PROMPT_MANAGEMENT.md`. Verification: `sqlite3 gryag.db ".schema system_prompts" && grep -c "def.*prompt" app/handlers/prompt_admin.py` (should show table + 5 handlers)

**October 7, 2025**: Removed local model infrastructure - bot now uses Google Gemini API exclusively. Deleted Phi-3-mini local model support, llama-cpp-python dependency, simplified fact extraction to 2-tier (rule-based + Gemini fallback). Updated 8 files, removed 2 services. Fact extraction now cloud-only via `ENABLE_GEMINI_FACT_EXTRACTION=true`. Verification: `! grep -r "LOCAL_MODEL" app/ && grep "enable_gemini_fact_extraction" app/config.py`

**October 7, 2025**: Added comprehensive universal bot configuration plan in `docs/plans/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PLAN.md`. This plan details how to transform the hardcoded gryag bot into a configurable universal framework supporting multiple personalities, languages, and group chat deployments. Verification: `grep -n "universal\|configurable\|persona" docs/plans/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PLAN.md`

**October 7, 2025**: Completed Phase 1 of universal bot configuration - configuration infrastructure. Added persona abstraction layer (`app/services/persona/`), created YAML persona configs (`personas/`), JSON response templates (`response_templates/`), and updated settings with 18 new configuration fields. See `docs/phases/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md` for details. Verification: `ls -la personas/ response_templates/ && python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('personas/ukrainian_gryag.yaml'))"`
