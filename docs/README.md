## Recent Changes

**October 19, 2025**: **Phase A & B Complete: External ID Storage + 7-Day Retention** - Fixed user ID truncation issue by adding dedicated TEXT columns for external IDs (external_message_id, external_user_id, reply_to_external_message_id, reply_to_external_user_id) to prevent JSON numeric precision loss. Reduced retention from 30 to 7 days with safe auto-pruning that excludes episode-referenced messages and message_importance overrides. Implemented background pruner task running daily. Created 6 new tests (all passing). Files: 8 modified, 2 new test files. See `docs/phases/PHASE_A_B_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`. Verification: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_external_ids.py tests/unit/test_retention.py -v` ‚Üí 6 passed

## Recent Changes

**October 17, 2025**: **üîë Separate API Key for Image Generation** - Added support for using a separate Google Gemini API key specifically for image generation. Set `IMAGE_GENERATION_API_KEY` in `.env` to use a different account/billing for images vs text generation. Falls back to `GEMINI_API_KEY` if not set (fully backward compatible). Benefits: independent billing, isolated API quotas, better cost control. See `docs/features/SEPARATE_IMAGE_API_KEY.md`. Verification: `grep "image_generation_api_key" app/config.py` and check logs for `"separate_api_key": true`

**October 17, 2025**: **üé® Image Generation Feature Added** - Implemented native image generation using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model. Bot can now generate images from text prompts with daily quota limits (1/day for users, unlimited for admins). Features: text-to-image, 9 aspect ratios, Ukrainian language support, automatic quota tracking per user/chat. Added `ImageGenerationService`, `image_quotas` table, tool definition, and middleware integration. Cost: ~$0.04/image. Enable with `ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION=true`. See `docs/features/IMAGE_GENERATION.md`. Verification: `sqlite3 gryag.db ".schema image_quotas"` and `grep "class ImageGenerationService" app/services/image_generation.py`

**October 17, 2025**: **‚úèÔ∏è Image Edit Tool Added** - Exposed `edit_image` tool that lets users edit an existing photo by replying to it with instructions. Uses the replied image as context for Gemini 2.5 image model. Wired into chat handler, added to persona tools, and reuses the same daily quota logic (admins bypass). Verification: reply to a photo with ‚Äú–∑–∞—Ç–µ–º–Ω–∏ —Ñ–æ–Ω —ñ –¥–æ–¥–∞–π –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å‚Äù and check logs for `Edit image tool called`.

**October 17, 2025**: **üñºÔ∏è Media Context Bug Fixed - Bot Can Now See Images/Videos/Audio!** - Fixed critical bug where bot couldn't see media in conversation context. Root cause: `_estimate_tokens()` in `MultiLevelContextManager` only counted text parts, ignoring `inline_data` (images/video/audio) and `file_data` (URLs). Media consumed 0 tokens in estimates, causing incorrect context truncation. Solution: Updated token estimator to count media (~258 tokens per image, ~100 per URL). Added debug logging to track media through context assembly. Created comprehensive unit tests verifying all media types. **Bot now properly sees and can respond to photos, videos, audio, documents, and stickers in conversation.** See `docs/fixes/MEDIA_CONTEXT_FIX.md`. Verification: Send image to bot, check logs for `grep "media items" logs/gryag.log`

**October 17, 2025**: **üîß Context Retrieval Fix - Bot Can Now See Full Conversation History!** - Fixed critical bug where `ContextStore.recent()` was treating `max_turns` parameter as message count instead of turn count (1 turn = 1 user + 1 bot = 2 messages). Result: with default `MAX_TURNS=20`, bot only saw 20 messages instead of 40, cutting context in half! Updated method to multiply by 2 and adjusted multi-level context manager to convert message counts properly. **Bot now has 2x more conversation context.** See `docs/fixes/CONTEXT_RETRIEVAL_FIX.md`. Verification: `PYTHONPATH=/home/thathunky/gryag pytest tests/integration/test_context_store.py::test_add_and_retrieve_turn -v` (should pass)

**October 17, 2025**: **ÔøΩüîß Context Retrieval Fix - Bot Can Now See Full Conversation History!** - Fixed critical bug where `ContextStore.recent()` was treating `max_turns` parameter as message count instead of turn count (1 turn = 1 user + 1 bot = 2 messages). Result: with default `MAX_TURNS=20`, bot only saw 20 messages instead of 40, cutting context in half! Updated method to multiply by 2 and adjusted multi-level context manager to convert message counts properly. **Bot now has 2x more conversation context.** See `docs/fixes/CONTEXT_RETRIEVAL_FIX.md`. Verification: `PYTHONPATH=/home/thathunky/gryag pytest tests/integration/test_context_store.py::test_add_and_retrieve_turn -v` (should pass)

**October 17, 2025**: **‚úÖ Compact Conversation Format Implemented (Phase 6)** - Successfully implemented compact plain text conversation format achieving **73.7% token reduction**! Format: `Alice#987654: Hello world` with reply chains `Bob ‚Üí Alice: Reply`. Implementation complete: formatter module (393 lines), multi-level context integration, chat handler branching, unit tests (378 lines), integration tests (263 lines). Token savings verified: 3-message conversation reduced from ~57 to ~15 tokens. Feature flag `ENABLE_COMPACT_CONVERSATION_FORMAT=false` (default off for testing). Benefits: 3-4x more history in same budget, human-readable, faster processing. Trade-offs: loss of structured metadata, media requires text descriptions. Ready for Phase 5 gradual rollout (pilot ‚Üí 10% ‚Üí full). See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (2025-10-17 entry) and `docs/plans/TODO_CONVO_PATTERN.md`. Verification: `PYTHONPATH=. python3 tests/integration/test_compact_format.py` (shows 73.7% savings)

**October 17, 2025**: **üìñ Documented Current Conversation Pattern** - Updated `docs/overview/CURRENT_CONVERSATION_PATTERN.md` with actual Gemini API format based on codebase investigation. Documents real structure: JSON with `role`/`parts` arrays, metadata blocks, media handling, tool calling, and code references. Added instructions to reference this doc in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `AGENTS.md`. Verification: `grep "CURRENT_CONVERSATION_PATTERN" .github/copilot-instructions.md AGENTS.md` (should show references in both files)

**October 16, 2025**: **‚úÖ Fact Lifecycle Verification Complete** - Comprehensive audit confirms bot CAN remember and forget all facts. Verification traced complete lifecycle: extraction (3 tiers: rule-based, hybrid, Gemini fallback) ‚Üí storage with versioning ‚Üí retrieval ‚Üí deletion (4 mechanisms: forget_fact_tool, forget_all_facts_tool, admin commands). Data integrity verified: CASCADE constraints protect fact_versions from orphans. Minor inconsistency noted: Gemini tools use hard delete, admin commands use soft delete (both functional, just different philosophy). Created `docs/guides/FACT_LIFECYCLE_VERIFICATION.md` with detailed flow diagrams, edge case analysis, and test recommendations. Verification: `cat docs/guides/FACT_LIFECYCLE_VERIFICATION.md | grep -c "‚úÖ"` (should show 10+ checkmarks)

**October 16, 2025**: **üß† Facts and Episodes System Improvements** - Implemented comprehensive improvements to fact extraction and episodic memory systems: (1) Added automatic fact versioning tracking change types (creation, reinforcement, evolution, correction), (2) Created fact value normalization module with canonical mappings for locations/languages (reduces duplicates by 30-50%), (3) Implemented embedding cache with SQLite persistence (60-80% fewer API calls), (4) Enhanced Gemini error logging with full response text, (5) Documented data model architecture. Created `docs/architecture/FACTS_STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md` explaining `user_facts` vs unified `facts` table usage. See `docs/fixes/FACTS_EPISODES_IMPROVEMENTS_2025_10_16.md` for full implementation. Verification: `sqlite3 gryag.db "SELECT fact_id, change_type, confidence_delta FROM fact_versions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5"` (should show version records)

**October 16, 2025**: **ÔøΩ Token Overflow FIXED: Added Token-Based Truncation** - Fixed critical issue where bot sent 1.7M tokens to Gemini API (exceeding 1M limit). Root cause: `MAX_TURNS=50` created 100 messages in fallback path. Solution: (1) Reduced default `MAX_TURNS` from 50‚Üí20, (2) Added `_truncate_history_to_tokens()` function with word-based estimation, (3) Applied truncation in fallback path respecting `CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET=8000`. Now guaranteed to stay under limits even with long messages. Files modified: `app/config.py`, `app/handlers/chat.py` (added 50-line truncation function), `.env.example` (updated docs). Added telemetry: `context.token_truncation`, `context.fallback_to_simple`. See `docs/fixes/token-overflow-fix.md` for implementation and `docs/fixes/token-overflow-investigation.md` for analysis. Verification: `docker compose logs -f bot | grep -i "truncat"` ‚Üí should show warnings only with exceptionally long conversations.

**October 16, 2025**: **ÔøΩüöÄ Phase 3 PRODUCTION DEPLOYED: Response Template System** - Universal Bot Phase 3 successfully deployed to production! Fixed critical Docker dependency issue (PyYAML missing), rebuilt container, verified PersonaLoader operational with 13 response templates and 2 admin users. Bot processing messages normally (275-734ms per message), no errors detected. System fully backward compatible with hardcoded defaults. See `docs/phases/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PHASE_3_DEPLOYMENT.md` for deployment timeline and `docs/phases/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md` for implementation details. Verification: `docker compose exec bot python -c "from app.services.persona import PersonaLoader; print('‚úÖ OK')"` ‚Üí "‚úÖ OK"

**October 16, 2025**: **üåç Phase 3 Complete: Response Template System Activated** - Completed the Universal Bot Configuration system (Phase 3) by fully integrating PersonaLoader into the middleware stack. All handlers (chat, admin) now use template-based responses instead of hardcoded strings. PersonaLoader instantiated when `ENABLE_PERSONA_TEMPLATES=true` (now default), templates loaded from YAML/JSON configs, and all 13+ response keys support variable substitution. Backward compatible: falls back to hardcoded defaults if templates unavailable. Created comprehensive integration tests (6 tests, all pass). Files: 6 modified (+93 lines), 1 new test file. See `docs/phases/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PHASE_3_COMPLETE.md`. Verification: `python scripts/verification/test_persona_integration.py` ‚Üí "6/6 tests passed".

**October 14, 2025**: **üîß /gryagreset Command Fixed** - Fixed `/gryagreset` failing with AttributeError by adding `reset_chat()` and `reset_user()` methods to RateLimiter class and updating admin handler to use them. Command now works correctly to clear rate limits. See `docs/fixes/gryagreset-attributeerror-fix.md`. Verification: Use `/gryagreset` as admin, check logs for "Reset X rate limit record(s)".

**October 14, 2025**: **üîì Admin Rate Limit Bypass Restored** - Fixed admins being subject to hourly message rate limits. Moved admin status check before rate limiting and added `not is_admin` condition. Admins (from `ADMIN_USER_IDS`) now have unlimited messages per hour while regular users are still limited by `RATE_LIMIT_PER_USER_PER_HOUR`. See `docs/fixes/admin-rate-limit-bypass.md`. Verification: Send 50+ messages in an hour as admin - should not be throttled.

**October 14, 2025**: **ÔøΩüîß User Identification Confusion Fix** - Fixed bot sometimes confusing users with similar display names (e.g., "–∫–∞–≤—É–Ω–µ–≤–∞ –ø—ñ—Ç—Å–∞" vs "–∫–∞–≤—É–Ω"). Increased name truncation limit from 30 to 60 characters in metadata formatting to preserve distinguishing suffixes, reordered metadata keys to show `user_id` and `username` before `name`, and strengthened persona with explicit "IDENTITY VERIFICATION RULE" emphasizing user_id checking. Minimal token increase (~5 tokens per turn) for significantly improved user identification accuracy. See `docs/fixes/user-identification-confusion-fix.md`. Verification: `grep "user_id=831570515" logs/gryag.log`

**October 16, 2025**: **üßä Monitoring Trim + Dependency Cleanup** - Disabled the psutil-based resource monitor/optimizer loop (no more CPU pressure spam) and removed `llama-cpp-python` plus its Docker build deps. The Docker image now installs only timezone data, and verification scripts no longer expect llama. Verification attempted: `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_system_prompt_manager.py tests/unit/test_episodic_memory_retrieval.py tests/unit/test_user_profiles.py` (requires local pytest).

**October 15, 2025**: **üß† Prompt Cache & Context QoL** - System prompt caching now stores full prompt objects (and cache-miss sentinels) with explicit hit/miss tracking exposed via `/gryagprompt`, the episodic memory lookup uses JSON participant checks so user `23` no longer matches `123`, `ChatMetaMiddleware` reuses a single `MultiLevelContextManager` instance to cut redundant SQLite work, chat membership events feed into `/gryagusers` for fast roster lookups, `/gryagprofile` shows real timestamps instead of ‚Äú–Ω–µ–≤—ñ–¥–æ–º–æ‚Äù, and the bot displays a live typing indicator while Gemini works. Added regression tests for the prompt cache, adapter init guard, episodic retrieval, and roster listings (blocked locally because `pytest` is not installed). Verification attempted: `python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_system_prompt_manager.py tests/unit/test_episodic_memory_retrieval.py tests/unit/test_user_profiles.py` (fails: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named pytest`).

**October 14, 2025**: **üîÑ Unified Facts Schema + Profiling Fixes** - Added the unified `facts` table to `db/schema.sql`, refreshed `updated_at` when profiles are revisited, fixed the background profile updater to use post-increment counters, routed forget/update tools through the unified fact repository (including purging stored chat turns), reinstated a configurable per-user/hour rate limiter backed by SQLite, taught the bot to remember and update user pronouns via a dedicated tool, refined Markdown sanitization so inline emphasis is stripped without breaking bullet lists/usernames, and hardened `compact_json()` truncation. Verification: `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/unit/test_repositories.py`

**October 9, 2025**: **‚ö° Token Optimization (Phase 5.2) COMPLETE** - Implemented comprehensive token efficiency improvements: (1) Token tracking with telemetry (6 new counters), (2) Semantic deduplication (15-30% reduction in relevant context), (3) Metadata compression (30-40% savings per block), (4) System prompt caching (1-hour TTL, -50ms per hit), (5) Compact tool responses (compact_json utility), (6) Token audit tool (scripts/diagnostics/token_audit.py), (7) Integration tests (test_token_budget.py). Overall impact: **25-35% token reduction** with <15ms added latency. Created `docs/guides/TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION.md` guide. 8 files modified, 3 files added. Verification: `python scripts/diagnostics/token_audit.py --summary-only && pytest tests/integration/test_token_budget.py -v`

**October 9, 2025**: **üîß Production Errors Fixed** - Fixed 3 categories of production errors: (1) Added 5 missing methods to UserProfileStoreAdapter (get_or_create_profile, get_user_summary, get_fact_count, get_profile, get_relationships) - was causing AttributeErrors in chat handlers and context assembly, (2) Added cleanup for aiohttp client sessions (WeatherService, CurrencyService) - was causing "Unclosed client session" warnings, (3) Documented CPU usage monitoring (115 warnings, system-level not bot issue). See `docs/fixes/production_errors_2025-10-09.md`. Verification: `grep "AttributeError.*UserProfileStoreAdapter" logs/gryag.log` (should be empty after restart)

**October 9, 2025**: **üîß Fix: UserProfileStoreAdapter.get_facts() TypeError** - Fixed production error where `get_facts()` method was missing `fact_type` and `min_confidence` parameters, causing 20+ TypeError exceptions in logs when using `/gryagfacts` command with type filters. Added both optional parameters with backward-compatible defaults. Verification: `grep -c "TypeError.*get_facts.*fact_type" logs/gryag.log` (should return 0 after deployment). See `docs/fixes/user_profile_adapter_get_facts_fix.md` for details.

**October 8, 2025**: **üéØ COMPLETE: Unified Fact Storage Implementation** - **All phases done!** Successfully migrated database (95 facts), created UnifiedFactRepository, built UserProfileStoreAdapter for backward compatibility, updated /gryagchatfacts command, and wrote comprehensive tests. Chat facts now work correctly - the bug where "–ª—é–±–∏—Ç–∏ –∫–∞–≤—É–Ω–æ–≤—É –ø—ñ—Ç—Å—É" was invisible is **FIXED**! Integration tests pass 100%. Created 5 new files: fact_repository.py, user_profile_adapter.py, test_unified_facts.py, migration script, and documentation. See `docs/phases/UNIFIED_FACT_STORAGE_COMPLETE.md` for full implementation details. Verification: `python scripts/verification/test_unified_facts.py` (all tests pass)

**October 8, 2025**: **üéØ MAJOR: Unified Fact Storage Architecture** - Replaced separate `user_facts` and `chat_facts` tables with single unified `facts` table. Fixed critical bug where chat facts were stored in wrong table and not visible in `/gryagchatfacts`. Migration successfully moved 95 facts (94 user, 1 chat) to new schema with entity_type detection. Old tables preserved as `*_old` for rollback safety. Created migration script `scripts/migrations/migrate_to_unified_facts.py` and comprehensive plan in `docs/plans/UNIFIED_FACT_STORAGE.md`. **Chat facts now work correctly!** Verification: `sqlite3 gryag.db "SELECT entity_type, COUNT(*) FROM facts GROUP BY entity_type"` (should show chat: 1, user: 94)

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Facts Storage Bug Identified** - Discovered critical bug: bot's memory tools store chat facts in `user_facts` table (using chat_id as user_id), but `/gryagchatfacts` command reads from separate `chat_facts` table. Result: facts are stored but not visible. Root cause: two independent fact systems developed without integration. Documented in `docs/fixes/CHAT_FACTS_NOT_SHOWING.md` with 3 solution options. Chose Option 3 (unify tables) as long-term fix. Verification: `cat docs/fixes/CHAT_FACTS_NOT_SHOWING.md | grep -c "user_facts\|chat_facts"` (shows the problem)

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Admin Commands (Phase 5 Complete) üéâ** - Implemented full admin interface for chat memory management. Created `/gryagchatfacts` command (shows facts grouped by category with confidence bars) and `/gryagchatreset` command (delete all chat facts with confirmation). Added `chat_admin_router` with emoji formatting and admin-only access control. **Chat Public Memory System is now FULLY OPERATIONAL** - all 5 phases complete! Verification: `test -f app/handlers/chat_admin.py && echo "‚úÖ"` 

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Initialization (Phase 4 Complete)** - Wired chat public memory into bot startup sequence. ChatProfileRepository now initializes on startup and gets injected into ContinuousMonitor (creates ChatFactExtractor internally) and ChatMetaMiddleware (makes it available to all handlers). Implemented abstract methods in ChatProfileRepository (find_by_id, save, delete). Next: create admin commands for chat fact management. Verification: `grep -c "chat_profile_store" app/main.py app/middlewares/chat_meta.py` (should show 6+ matches)

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Integration (Phase 3 Complete)** - Integrated chat-level memory extraction and retrieval into the continuous monitoring pipeline and multi-level context system. Added `raw_messages` field to `ConversationWindow`, implemented `_store_chat_facts()` in ContinuousMonitor, extended `BackgroundContext` with chat facts. Token budget: 60% user facts (720 tokens), 40% chat facts (480 tokens). Modified 3 core files: `continuous_monitor.py`, `conversation_analyzer.py`, `multi_level_context.py`. Next: initialize in main.py, create admin commands. See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (2025-10-08 entry). Verification: `bash scripts/verification/verify_chat_memory_integration.sh` (33/37 checks passing)der contains the repository documentation organized into subfolders. When moving or reorganizing docs, follow the rules in `AGENTS.md` and add a short summary here describing the change.

## Recent Changes

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Integration (Phase 3 Complete)** - Integrated chat-level memory system into continuous monitoring and multi-level context pipelines. Added `raw_messages` field to `ConversationWindow`, implemented `_store_chat_facts()` in ContinuousMonitor, extended `BackgroundContext` with chat facts. Token budget: 60% user facts (720 tokens), 40% chat facts (480 tokens). Modified 3 core files: `continuous_monitor.py`, `conversation_analyzer.py`, `multi_level_context.py`. Next: initialize in main.py, create admin commands. See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (2025-10-08 entry). Verification: `bash scripts/verification/verify_chat_memory_integration.sh` (33/37 checks passing)

**October 8, 2025**: **Chat Public Memory Plan** - Created comprehensive design plan for group-level memory system. Bot will now remember chat-wide facts (preferences, traditions, rules, culture) separate from user-specific facts. Includes: new database schema (`chat_facts` table), extraction methods (pattern, statistical, LLM), integration with multi-level context, and token budget management (400 tokens max). 4-week implementation roadmap. See `docs/plans/CHAT_PUBLIC_MEMORY.md`. Verification: `grep -c "chat_facts\|ChatFactExtractor\|chat_profile" docs/plans/CHAT_PUBLIC_MEMORY.md` (should show 50+ matches)

**October 8, 2025**: **Repository Cleanup and Organization** - Organized root-level files into proper directories. Moved 3 markdown docs to `docs/`, 19 Python scripts to `scripts/` (organized into migrations/, diagnostics/, tests/, verification/, deprecated/), and 6 shell scripts to `scripts/verification/`. Created `scripts/README.md` with comprehensive inventory. Only `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` remain at root. See changelog entry below. Verification: `ls -1 *.py *.sh *.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v -E "^(README.md|AGENTS.md)$"` (should return empty) and `tree scripts/ -L 1` (should show organized subdirectories)

**October 8, 2025**: **Google Search Grounding SDK Compatibility Fix** - Attempted to modernize to `google_search` format but discovered bot uses legacy `google.generativeai` SDK which only supports `google_search_retrieval`. Reverted to working configuration with detailed documentation. Error: `ValueError: Unknown field for FunctionDeclaration: google_search`. Modified `app/handlers/chat.py` (reverted with explanatory comment), updated docs. See `docs/fixes/SEARCH_GROUNDING_API_UPDATE.md`. Verification: `grep "google_search_retrieval" app/handlers/chat.py` (should find the working format)

# Documentation Index

Recent significant changes:

1. **2025-01-29**: [Google Gemini SDK Migration](fixes/SEARCH_GROUNDING_SDK_MIGRATION.md) - Migrated from `google-generativeai` 0.8.5 to `google-genai` 0.2+ for native Gemini 2.5 support
2. **2025-10-08**: [Reply Message Media Visibility Fix](fixes/REPLY_MEDIA_VISIBILITY_FIX.md) - Fixed media context in replies (was being silently dropped)

**October 7, 2025**: Implemented **Comprehensive Model Capability Detection System** - Bot now automatically adapts to different Gemini model families (Gemma, Gemini, Flash) by detecting and gracefully handling: audio support, video support, media count limits, function calling (tools), rate limiting, and historical context filtering. Five fixes in total: (1) media count limiting (max 28 for Gemma), (2) current message media filtering by type, (3) historical context two-phase filtering, (4) rate limit warnings, (5) tool support detection and disabling. Works with zero configuration - just set `GEMINI_MODEL` and capabilities are auto-detected. See `docs/features/comprehensive-model-capability-detection.md` and 5 detailed fix docs in `docs/fixes/` and `docs/features/`. Verification: `grep -E "_detect.*support|_is_media_supported|_limit_media_in_history" app/services/gemini.py app/services/context/multi_level_context.py | wc -l` (should show 15+ matches)

**October 7, 2025**: Completed **Phase 2: Universal Bot Configuration** - Bot now supports multiple deployments with different identities. Added dynamic command prefixes (17 commands support both `/gryag*` and `/{prefix}*`), chat filter middleware (whitelist/blacklist modes), configurable trigger patterns, Redis namespace isolation, and `/chatinfo` command. All configurable via `.env` without code changes. See `docs/phases/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md`. Verification: `grep -r "ChatFilterMiddleware\|initialize_triggers\|chatinfo_command" app/ | wc -l` (should show 5+ matches)

**October 7, 2025**: Added **System Prompt Management** feature - admins can now customize bot personality via Telegram commands. Created `SystemPromptManager` service with database persistence, version history, and rollback. New commands: `/gryagprompt`, `/gryagsetprompt`, `/gryagresetprompt`, `/gryagprompthistory`, `/gryagactivateprompt`. Supports global and chat-specific prompts with file upload. See `docs/features/SYSTEM_PROMPT_MANAGEMENT.md`. Verification: `sqlite3 gryag.db ".schema system_prompts" && grep -c "def.*prompt" app/handlers/prompt_admin.py` (should show table + 5 handlers)

**October 7, 2025**: Removed local model infrastructure - bot now uses Google Gemini API exclusively. Deleted Phi-3-mini local model support, llama-cpp-python dependency, simplified fact extraction to 2-tier (rule-based + Gemini fallback). Updated 8 files, removed 2 services. Fact extraction now cloud-only via `ENABLE_GEMINI_FACT_EXTRACTION=true`. Verification: `! grep -r "LOCAL_MODEL" app/ && grep "enable_gemini_fact_extraction" app/config.py`

**October 7, 2025**: Added comprehensive universal bot configuration plan in `docs/plans/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PLAN.md`. This plan details how to transform the hardcoded gryag bot into a configurable universal framework supporting multiple personalities, languages, and group chat deployments. Verification: `grep -n "universal\|configurable\|persona" docs/plans/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PLAN.md`

**October 7, 2025**: Completed Phase 1 of universal bot configuration - configuration infrastructure. Added persona abstraction layer (`app/services/persona/`), created YAML persona configs (`personas/`), JSON response templates (`response_templates/`), and updated settings with 18 new configuration fields. See `docs/phases/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md` for details. Verification: `ls -la personas/ response_templates/ && python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('personas/ukrainian_gryag.yaml'))"`

- üîÑ **Configuration**: Disabled automated memory systems, now tool-based only
- üìä **Testing**: 12 tests passing (added 3 forget tests)
- üéØ **Use Cases**: User privacy requests, obsolete data cleanup
- ‚ö° **Performance**: 60-90ms latency for forget operations
- üîß **Breaking**: Automated fact extraction and continuous monitoring now disabled
- See: `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (2025-10-07 entry)
- Verification: `python test_memory_tools_phase5.py` (should pass all 12 tests)
- Config: `.env` now has `ENABLE_TOOL_BASED_MEMORY=true`, automation disabled

**October 3, 2025**: Phase 5.1 Complete - Tool-Based Memory Control
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Complete**: 3 core memory tools with Gemini function calling
- Tools: `remember_fact` (store), `recall_facts` (search), `update_fact` (modify)
- Model now decides when to remember/update facts instead of automated heuristics
- Performance: 70-140ms latency (well within 200ms target)
- Testing: 9 integration tests (all passing ‚úÖ)
- Configuration: 5 new settings (`ENABLE_TOOL_BASED_MEMORY`, `MEMORY_TOOL_ASYNC`, etc.)
- Files: 6 new (`app/services/tools/`, 3 plan docs), 4 modified (handler, config, persona, docs)
- See: `phases/PHASE_5.1_COMPLETE.md`, `plans/MEMORY_TOOL_CALLING_REDESIGN.md`
- Verification: `python test_memory_tools_phase5.py` (should pass all 9 tests)
- Next: Phase 5.2 (6 additional tools: episodes, forget, merge)

**October 7, 2025**: Memory System Redesign Plan
- üìã **New Plan**: Tool-based memory management using Gemini function calling
- Shift from automated heuristics to model-controlled memory operations
- 9 new tools: remember_fact, recall_facts, update_fact, create_episode, forget_fact, merge_facts, etc.
- Async orchestrator for non-blocking memory operations (< 200ms overhead)
- 3-week implementation roadmap (Phase 5.1-5.3)
- See: `plans/MEMORY_TOOL_CALLING_REDESIGN.md`
- Verification: `grep -c "Function Declaration" docs/plans/MEMORY_TOOL_CALLING_REDESIGN.md` (should show 9)

**October 7, 2025**: Bot Self-Learning Integration Analysis
- üî¥ **Critical Issue Found**: Bot self-learning infrastructure exists but is never called from chat handler
- Root cause: Missing integration between `app/handlers/chat.py` and `BotLearningEngine`
- All services implemented but unused - 0 interactions tracked despite `ENABLE_BOT_SELF_LEARNING=true`
- Detailed fix plan: `docs/fixes/BOT_SELF_LEARNING_INTEGRATION_FIX.md` (requires ~6-9 hours implementation)
- Verification: Check `/gryagself` shows 0 interactions despite bot responding normally

**October 7, 2025**: Added time awareness to bot
- ‚úÖ Bot now receives current timestamp with every message
- ‚úÖ Format: "The current time is: {Day}, {Month} {Date}, {Year} at {HH:MM:SS}"
- ‚úÖ Enables time-aware responses and context-appropriate greetings
- ‚úÖ Negligible performance impact (<1ms per message)
- See: `features/TIME_AWARENESS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (2025-10-07 entry)
- Verification: `python3 test_timestamp_feature.py` to see format, or ask bot "What time is it?"

**October 6, 2025**: Bug fixes for Bot Self-Learning and User Profiling
- Fixed KeyError in Gemini fact extraction prompt (`app/services/user_profile.py` lines 36-46)
- Fixed AttributeError in `/gryaginsights` command (`app/services/bot_learning.py` line 394)
- Fixed UNIQUE constraint violation in `bot_profiles` table (`db/schema.sql`)
- See `docs/fixes/fact_extraction_keyerror_fix.md`, `docs/fixes/bot_learning_gemini_response_fix.md`, and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- Verification: `docker compose logs --since <restart_time> bot | grep -E "KeyError.*facts|AttributeError"` (should show no errors)

**October 6, 2025**: Phase 5 Complete - Bot Self-Learning System
- ‚úÖ Bot learns about itself: tracks effectiveness, communication patterns, knowledge gaps
- ‚úÖ 8 fact categories: communication_style, knowledge_domain, tool_effectiveness, user_interaction, persona_adjustment, mistake_pattern, temporal_pattern, performance_metric
- ‚úÖ Semantic deduplication with embeddings (85% similarity threshold)
- ‚úÖ Temporal decay for outdated facts (exponential: confidence * exp(-decay_rate * age_days))
- ‚úÖ Gemini-powered self-reflection insights (weekly)
- ‚úÖ Two new Gemini tools: query_bot_self, get_bot_effectiveness
- ‚úÖ Admin commands: /gryagself, /gryaginsights
- ‚úÖ Integrates with episodic memory for conversation-level learning
- ‚úÖ Performance tracking: response_time_ms, token_count, sentiment_score
- ‚úÖ 6 new database tables, 15 indexes
- See: `features/BOT_SELF_LEARNING.md`, `phases/PHASE_5_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Verification: `sqlite3 gryag.db ".tables" | grep bot_` should show 6 tables

- ‚úÖ Bot can now see images in past messages when tagged in replies
- ‚úÖ All messages (addressed + unaddressed) now persisted to database with media
- ‚úÖ Embeddings generated for all messages for semantic search
- ‚úÖ Multi-level context includes complete media history
- See: `fixes/UNADDRESSED_MEDIA_PERSISTENCE.md`
