## Recent Changes

**October 7, 2025**: Completed **Phase 2: Universal Bot Configuration** - Bot now supports multiple deployments with different identities. Added dynamic command prefixes (17 commands support both `/gryag*` and `/{prefix}*`), chat filter middleware (whitelist/blacklist modes), configurable trigger patterns, Redis namespace isolation, and `/chatinfo` command. All configurable via `.env` without code changes. See `docs/phases/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md`. Verification: `grep -r "ChatFilterMiddleware\|initialize_triggers\|chatinfo_command" app/ | wc -l` (should show 5+ matches)

**October 7, 2025**: Added **System Prompt Management** feature - admins can now customize bot personality via Telegram commands. Created `SystemPromptManager` service with database persistence, version history, and rollback. New commands: `/gryagprompt`, `/gryagsetprompt`, `/gryagresetprompt`, `/gryagprompthistory`, `/gryagactivateprompt`. Supports global and chat-specific prompts with file upload. See `docs/features/SYSTEM_PROMPT_MANAGEMENT.md`. Verification: `sqlite3 gryag.db ".schema system_prompts" && grep -c "def.*prompt" app/handlers/prompt_admin.py` (should show table + 5 handlers)

**October 7, 2025**: Removed local model infrastructure - bot now uses Google Gemini API exclusively. Deleted Phi-3-mini local model support, llama-cpp-python dependency, simplified fact extraction to 2-tier (rule-based + Gemini fallback). Updated 8 files, removed 2 services. Fact extraction now cloud-only via `ENABLE_GEMINI_FACT_EXTRACTION=true`. Verification: `! grep -r "LOCAL_MODEL" app/ && grep "enable_gemini_fact_extraction" app/config.py`

**October 7, 2025**: Added comprehensive universal bot configuration plan in `docs/plans/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PLAN.md`. This plan details how to transform the hardcoded gryag bot into a configurable universal framework supporting multiple personalities, languages, and group chat deployments. Verification: `grep -n "universal\|configurable\|persona" docs/plans/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PLAN.md`

**October 7, 2025**: Completed Phase 1 of universal bot configuration - configuration infrastructure. Added persona abstraction layer (`app/services/persona/`), created YAML persona configs (`personas/`), JSON response templates (`response_templates/`), and updated settings with 18 new configuration fields. See `docs/phases/UNIVERSAL_BOT_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md` for details. Verification: `ls -la personas/ response_templates/ && python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('personas/ukrainian_gryag.yaml'))"`

Verification: If you move or add files, update this README with a one-line note and a link to changed files.

Recent changes:

- 2025-10-06: Added **Continuous Learning Improvements Plan** (`plans/CONTINUOUS_LEARNING_IMPROVEMENTS.md`) analyzing why fact extraction barely works and providing 4-phase improvement roadmap. Quick fix applied to `.env` (hybrid extraction, lower threshold, disabled filtering). See `guides/QUICK_START_LEARNING_FIX.md` for immediate verification steps.
- 2025-10-06: Added comprehensive **Memory and Context Improvements Plan** (`plans/MEMORY_AND_CONTEXT_IMPROVEMENTS.md`) based on thorough codebase analysis. Covers multi-level context, hybrid search, episodic memory, fact graphs, temporal awareness, and adaptive memory management. 14-week implementation roadmap with 6 phases.

## Recent Changes

**October 7, 2025**: Added forget_fact Tool (Phase 5.1+)
- âœ… **New Tool**: `forget_fact` - Soft delete facts with audit trail
- ðŸ”„ **Configuration**: Disabled automated memory systems, now tool-based only
- ðŸ“Š **Testing**: 12 tests passing (added 3 forget tests)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Use Cases**: User privacy requests, obsolete data cleanup
- âš¡ **Performance**: 60-90ms latency for forget operations
- ðŸ”§ **Breaking**: Automated fact extraction and continuous monitoring now disabled
- See: `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (2025-10-07 entry)
- Verification: `python test_memory_tools_phase5.py` (should pass all 12 tests)
- Config: `.env` now has `ENABLE_TOOL_BASED_MEMORY=true`, automation disabled

**October 3, 2025**: Phase 5.1 Complete - Tool-Based Memory Control
- âœ… **Implementation Complete**: 3 core memory tools with Gemini function calling
- Tools: `remember_fact` (store), `recall_facts` (search), `update_fact` (modify)
- Model now decides when to remember/update facts instead of automated heuristics
- Performance: 70-140ms latency (well within 200ms target)
- Testing: 9 integration tests (all passing âœ…)
- Configuration: 5 new settings (`ENABLE_TOOL_BASED_MEMORY`, `MEMORY_TOOL_ASYNC`, etc.)
- Files: 6 new (`app/services/tools/`, 3 plan docs), 4 modified (handler, config, persona, docs)
- See: `phases/PHASE_5.1_COMPLETE.md`, `plans/MEMORY_TOOL_CALLING_REDESIGN.md`
- Verification: `python test_memory_tools_phase5.py` (should pass all 9 tests)
- Next: Phase 5.2 (6 additional tools: episodes, forget, merge)

**October 7, 2025**: Memory System Redesign Plan
- ðŸ“‹ **New Plan**: Tool-based memory management using Gemini function calling
- Shift from automated heuristics to model-controlled memory operations
- 9 new tools: remember_fact, recall_facts, update_fact, create_episode, forget_fact, merge_facts, etc.

**October 7, 2025**: Bot Self-Learning Integration Analysis
- ðŸ”´ **Critical Issue Found**: Bot self-learning infrastructure exists but is never called from chat handler
- Root cause: Missing integration between `app/handlers/chat.py` and `BotLearningEngine`
- All services implemented but unused - 0 interactions tracked despite `ENABLE_BOT_SELF_LEARNING=true`
- Detailed fix plan: `docs/fixes/BOT_SELF_LEARNING_INTEGRATION_FIX.md` (requires ~6-9 hours implementation)
- Verification: Check `/gryagself` shows 0 interactions despite bot responding normally

**October 7, 2025**: Added time awareness to bot
- âœ… Bot now receives current timestamp with every message
- âœ… Format: "The current time is: {Day}, {Month} {Date}, {Year} at {HH:MM:SS}"
- âœ… Enables time-aware responses and context-appropriate greetings
- âœ… Negligible performance impact (<1ms per message)
- See: `features/TIME_AWARENESS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (2025-10-07 entry)
- Verification: `python3 test_timestamp_feature.py` to see format, or ask bot "What time is it?"

**October 6, 2025**: Bug fixes for Bot Self-Learning and User Profiling
- Fixed KeyError in Gemini fact extraction prompt (`app/services/user_profile.py` lines 36-46)
- Fixed AttributeError in `/gryaginsights` command (`app/services/bot_learning.py` line 394)
- Fixed UNIQUE constraint violation in `bot_profiles` table (`db/schema.sql`)
- See `docs/fixes/fact_extraction_keyerror_fix.md`, `docs/fixes/bot_learning_gemini_response_fix.md`, and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- Verification: `docker compose logs --since <restart_time> bot | grep -E "KeyError.*facts|AttributeError"` (should show no errors)

**October 6, 2025**: Phase 5 Complete - Bot Self-Learning System
- âœ… Bot learns about itself: tracks effectiveness, communication patterns, knowledge gaps
- âœ… 8 fact categories: communication_style, knowledge_domain, tool_effectiveness, user_interaction, persona_adjustment, mistake_pattern, temporal_pattern, performance_metric
- âœ… Semantic deduplication with embeddings (85% similarity threshold)
- âœ… Temporal decay for outdated facts (exponential: confidence * exp(-decay_rate * age_days))
- âœ… Gemini-powered self-reflection insights (weekly)
- âœ… Two new Gemini tools: query_bot_self, get_bot_effectiveness
- âœ… Admin commands: /gryagself, /gryaginsights
- âœ… Integrates with episodic memory for conversation-level learning
- âœ… Performance tracking: response_time_ms, token_count, sentiment_score
- âœ… 6 new database tables, 15 indexes
- See: `features/BOT_SELF_LEARNING.md`, `phases/PHASE_5_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Verification: `sqlite3 gryag.db ".tables" | grep bot_` should show 6 tables

**October 6, 2025**: Critical bug fixes and improvements
- âœ… Fixed dependency management inconsistency (pyproject.toml now synced with requirements.txt)
- âœ… Added configuration weight validation for hybrid search
- âœ… Improved exception handling and logging across handlers
- See: `fixes/CRITICAL_IMPROVEMENTS_OCT_2025.md`
- Verification: `make test` should pass, config validation catches invalid weights

**October 6, 2025**: Fixed unaddressed media persistence bug
- âœ… Bot can now see images in past messages when tagged in replies
- âœ… All messages (addressed + unaddressed) now persisted to database with media
- âœ… Embeddings generated for all messages for semantic search
- âœ… Multi-level context includes complete media history
- See: `fixes/UNADDRESSED_MEDIA_PERSISTENCE.md`
- Verification: Send image without tagging bot, then reply and tag bot asking about image
