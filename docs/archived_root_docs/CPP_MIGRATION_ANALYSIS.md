# C++ Migration Analysis: Gryag Bot Status Report

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Migration in Progress (~50-60% Complete)
**Scope**: Partial feature parity achieved; core functionality ported; advanced features remain

---

## Executive Summary

The gryag Telegram bot is **undergoing a staged migration from Python to C++**. As of now:

✅ **Completed in C++** (~50-60% of functionality)
- Core runtime (settings, logging, database)
- Message persistence and context store
- Gemini AI client (text, embeddings, image generation)
- Core tool integrations (weather, currency, calculator, search, polls, image generation)
- Admin and profile management commands
- Basic telegram long-polling client
- Persona loading and message formatting

❌ **Still in Python Only** (~40-50% of functionality)
- Chat admin handlers (chat-specific memory management)
- Prompt admin handlers (custom system prompts)
- Advanced context retrieval (hybrid search with embeddings)
- Episodic memory management and summarization
- Background services (donation scheduler, retention pruning, episode monitoring)
- Bot self-learning engine
- Comprehensive media handling
- Feature-level rate limiting and adaptive throttling
- Golden transcript testing and CI/CD

**Conclusion**: The functionality is **NOT completely transferred** to C++. The project is mid-migration with core infrastructure in place but important features still depending on Python.
