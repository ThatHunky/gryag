# Continuous Learning Fix - Summary

**Status**: ✅ Configuration changes applied  
**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Next Steps**: Verify improvements, monitor for 1 week

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Root Cause Analysis ✅

Identified why continuous fact extraction "barely works":

**Problems Found**:
- ❌ Using only rule-based extraction (70% coverage, should use hybrid 85%)
- ❌ Confidence threshold too high (0.8, should be 0.7)
- ❌ Message filtering too aggressive (40-60% filtered out)
- ❌ Only window-based extraction (3-minute delay)
- ❌ No observability (can't verify what's happening)

**Throttling Investigation**:
- ✅ Continuous monitoring runs BEFORE throttle check
- ✅ Throttle only affects addressed messages (bot replies)
- ✅ Unaddressed messages processed via windows
- **Conclusion**: Throttling is NOT blocking learning

### 2. Configuration Fixes Applied ✅

Updated `.env` file:

```diff
# Better extraction method
- FACT_EXTRACTION_METHOD=rule_based      # 70% coverage
+ FACT_EXTRACTION_METHOD=hybrid          # 85% coverage (regex + local LLM)

# Enable fallback for complex cases
- ENABLE_GEMINI_FALLBACK=false
+ ENABLE_GEMINI_FALLBACK=true

# More lenient threshold
- FACT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.8          # Too strict
+ FACT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7          # Default/recommended

# Disable filtering temporarily to see impact
- ENABLE_MESSAGE_FILTERING=true          # Blocks 40-60% of messages
+ ENABLE_MESSAGE_FILTERING=false         # Process everything
```

**Expected Results**:
- 2-3x more facts extracted
- 70% → 85% extraction coverage
- All messages processed (100% vs ~50%)
- Better visibility into what's working

## How to Verify

### Option 1: Run Verification Script (Recommended)

```bash
./verify_learning.sh
```

Expected output:
```
=== Continuous Learning System Verification ===

1. Checking local model...
   ✅ Local model found
   
2. Checking .env configuration...
   FACT_EXTRACTION_METHOD=hybrid
   FACT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7
   ENABLE_MESSAGE_FILTERING=false
   
3. Checking recent fact extraction (last 24 hours)...
   total_facts | unique_users | first_fact | last_fact
   -----------+-------------+------------+-----------
   [Shows extraction stats]
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing

1. **Check configuration**:
   ```bash
   grep FACT_EXTRACTION_METHOD .env
   # Should show: FACT_EXTRACTION_METHOD=hybrid
   ```

2. **Ensure local model downloaded** (~2.2GB):
   ```bash
   ls -lh models/phi-3-mini-q4.gguf
   # If not found: bash download_model.sh
   ```

3. **Restart bot**:
   ```bash
   python -m app.main
   ```

4. **Send test messages** in Telegram:
   - "я з Києва"
   - "я програміст, працюю з Python вже 5 років"
   - "я люблю кодити"

5. **Wait 5 minutes** (for window to close)

6. **Check database**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 gryag.db "
   SELECT fact_type, fact_value, confidence,
          datetime(created_at, 'localtime') as created
   FROM user_facts 
   WHERE created_at > datetime('now', '-10 minutes')
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   "
   ```

### Option 3: Live Monitoring

Watch logs in real-time:
```bash
python -m app.main 2>&1 | grep -E 'facts|window|extract|classification' --color=always
```

Expected logs:
```
INFO - ContinuousMonitor initialized
INFO - Conversation window closed: Timeout 300s exceeded
INFO - Extracted N facts from window
INFO - Quality processing: N → M facts
INFO - Stored M facts for user 12345
```

## What's Next

### Week 1: Monitor and Measure

1. **Run verification daily**:
   ```bash
   ./verify_learning.sh > learning_stats_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
   ```

2. **Collect baseline metrics**:
   - Facts extracted per day
   - Window processing rate
   - Quality metrics (duplicates, conflicts)

3. **Check for issues**:
   - Too many low-quality facts? → Re-enable filtering
   - High CPU usage? → Reduce local model threads
   - Missing facts? → Check logs for errors

### Week 2: Implement Dual-Path Extraction (Phase 2)

**Goal**: Extract facts from addressed messages immediately (0s vs 3-minute delay)

**Changes**:
- Add immediate extraction handler in `chat.py`
- Refactor fact storage for reuse
- Add metrics (immediate vs window extraction)

**Expected Impact**:
- Addressed messages: 0s latency (was 3 minutes)
- 3-4x increase in total facts extracted
- Better user experience (bot learns immediately)

### Week 3: Polish (Phases 3-4)

**Phase 3**: Adaptive window timing
- Active conversations: 1-2 minute windows
- Inactive conversations: 3 minute windows
- Faster fact extraction without losing context

**Phase 4**: Observability dashboard
- `/gryaglearning` admin command
- View stats, health, classification breakdown
- Easier debugging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### "No facts being extracted"

**Check logs**:
```bash
python -m app.main 2>&1 | tee bot.log
grep -i "error\|exception\|failed" bot.log | grep -i "fact"
```

**Common issues**:
- Local model not found → `bash download_model.sh`
- Gemini API key invalid → Check `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Confidence too high → Lower to 0.6 temporarily
- Windows not closing → Check conversation timeout settings

### "Too many low-quality facts"

**Re-enable filtering**:
```bash
# In .env
ENABLE_MESSAGE_FILTERING=true
```

**Increase threshold**:
```bash
# In .env
FACT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75
```

### "Bot is slow / High CPU"

**Option 1**: Reduce local model threads
```bash
# In .env
LOCAL_MODEL_THREADS=1  # Was 2
```

**Option 2**: Use Gemini-only (slower, API costs)
```bash
# In .env
FACT_EXTRACTION_METHOD=gemini
ENABLE_GEMINI_FALLBACK=false
```

**Option 3**: Reduce window size
```bash
# In .env
CONVERSATION_WINDOW_SIZE=3  # Was 5
```
