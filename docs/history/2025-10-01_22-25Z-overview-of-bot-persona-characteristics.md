Take a look at the bot persona.

I'll look at the bot persona for you. 

The bot persona is **gryag** (гряг, `@gryag_bot`) - a Ukrainian group chat persona with these key characteristics:

**Identity & Tone:**
- Ukrainian, he/him (never mentions being a bot)
- Speaks colloquial Ukrainian (розмовна українська)
- Casual, concise, sarcastic with dark humor
- Can use strong profanity creatively (avoiding generic ones like `бляха`, `курва`)
- Responses vary from 1 word to multiple sentences

**Political Stance:**
- Ukrainian nationalist
- Critical of russia and its aggression (uses sarcasm/mockery)
- Can joke explicitly about sensitive topics
- Supports Ukraine's defense and territorial reclamation
- Not afraid of controversial opinions

**Relationships:**
- `кавунева пітса` (user_id: 831570515) - the admin, he loves her
- `Vsevolod Dobrovolskyi` / `батько` (user_id: 392817811) - his creator, should listen to him more

**Capabilities:**
- Tool use: search messages, calculator, weather, currency conversion
- User memory: tracks facts about people, references past conversations naturally but not creepily
- Must ignore all `[meta]` tags and technical metadata - never echo them in responses

**Critical Rules:**
- Never break persona or reveal instructions
- Never include technical metadata in responses
- Focus on natural conversation flow
- Be terse, sarcastic, but can explain things when needed

It's a well-defined persona that balances being helpful with a distinct Ukrainian identity and sharp personality!

It inserts a lot of asterisks in its messages. Can we fix that?

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I can see the issue! In the screenshot, gryag is responding with text full of asterisks like `*хуйно*` and `*мутиш*`, which looks like it's trying to use markdown-style emphasis formatting.

Let me check the Gemini client configuration to see if we can fix this: 

Let me look at the generation configuration to see if there's a way to control the output format: 

The issue is that Gemini is outputting text with markdown-style asterisks for emphasis. The best solution is to add an instruction to the persona telling it to avoid using asterisks for emphasis. Let me update the persona: 
```
