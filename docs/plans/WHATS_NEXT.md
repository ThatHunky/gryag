# What's Next: Action Plan

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Current Status**: Phase 4.2 Complete âœ…  
**Next Focus**: Production Deployment & Phase 4.2.1

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Recent Achievement: Phase 4.2 Complete!

**Phase 4.2 "Automatic Episode Creation"** has been:
- âœ… Fully implemented (450+ lines)
- âœ… Comprehensively tested (33/33 tests passing)
- âœ… Fully integrated (main.py, middleware, handlers)
- âœ… Verified working (bot starts, monitoring active)
- âœ… Production ready

**See**: `PHASE_4_2_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for full details.

---

## Immediate Actions (Today/Tomorrow)

### 1. Deploy Phase 4.2 to Production âœ… Ready

The episode monitoring system is production-ready. To deploy:

```bash
# 1. Verify configuration
cat .env | grep ENABLE_MULTI_LEVEL_CONTEXT
# Should show: ENABLE_MULTI_LEVEL_CONTEXT=true

# 2. Restart the bot (if already running)
docker-compose restart bot

# Or start fresh
docker-compose up bot

# 3. Watch logs for initialization
docker-compose logs -f bot | grep "Multi-level"
# Should see: "Multi-level context services initialized"
```

**Expected**: Bot will automatically use multi-level context for all messages.

### 2. Monitor Initial Performance

Watch these metrics in the first 24 hours:

```bash
# Context assembly frequency
grep "Multi-level context assembled" logs | wc -l

# Average assembly time
grep "Multi-level context assembled" logs | grep -o "assembly_time_ms":[0-9.]* | awk '{sum+=$1; n++} END {print sum/n}'

# Fallback rate (should be low)
grep "Multi-level context assembly failed" logs | wc -l

# Token usage distribution
grep "total_tokens" logs | grep -o "[0-9]*/8000"
```

**Target Metrics**:
- Assembly time: <500ms (p95)
- Fallback rate: <1%
- Token usage: 2000-6000/8000 (reasonable utilization)

### 3. Collect User Feedback

Engage with users in your test chat:

```
Questions to ask:
- "How's the bot responding today?"
- "Does it remember previous conversations better?"
- "Any noticeable performance changes?"
```

**Track**:
- Response quality improvements
- Memory recall accuracy
- Any confusion or errors
- Performance complaints

## Short Term (This Week)

### 1. Fine-Tune Configuration

Based on monitoring data, adjust:

**If assembly time >500ms often**:
```bash
# Reduce token budget
CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET=4000

# Or disable episodic (smallest impact)
ENABLE_EPISODIC_MEMORY=false
```

**If responses lack context**:
```bash
# Increase budget
CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET=12000

# Or adjust ratios (more relevant context)
CONTEXT_RELEVANT_RATIO=0.35  # Up from 0.25
CONTEXT_BACKGROUND_RATIO=0.10  # Down from 0.15
```

**If keyword search is noisy**:
```bash
# Favor semantic over keyword
SEMANTIC_WEIGHT=0.6  # Up from 0.5
KEYWORD_WEIGHT=0.2   # Down from 0.3
```

### 2. Database Maintenance

Ensure optimal performance:

```bash
# Connect to database
sqlite3 gryag.db

# Rebuild statistics
ANALYZE;

# Optimize indexes
PRAGMA optimize;

# Check FTS index health
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages_fts;
# Should match message count

# Vacuum if needed (weekly)
VACUUM;
```

### 3. Create Monitoring Dashboard

Set up simple metrics tracking:

```bash
# Create monitoring script
cat > monitor_context.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Multi-Level Context Metrics ==="
echo "Last 1000 messages:"
echo

# Assembly count
echo -n "Assemblies: "
tail -1000 bot.log | grep -c "Multi-level context assembled"

# Average time
echo -n "Avg time: "
tail -1000 bot.log | grep "assembly_time_ms" | \
  awk -F': ' '{sum+=$2; n++} END {printf "%.1fms\n", sum/n}'

# Fallbacks
echo -n "Fallbacks: "
tail -1000 bot.log | grep -c "Multi-level context assembly failed"

# Token usage
echo "Token usage:"
tail -1000 bot.log | grep "total_tokens" | \
  awk -F': ' '{print $2}' | sort -n | \
  awk 'BEGIN {print "  min/p50/p95/max"} 
       {a[NR]=$1} 
       END {print "  " a[1] "/" a[int(NR*0.5)] "/" a[int(NR*0.95)] "/" a[NR]}'
EOF

chmod +x monitor_context.sh

# Run daily
./monitor_context.sh
```

## Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Start Phase 4: Episode Boundary Detection

**Goal**: Automatically create episodes during conversations

**Task 1: Implement Boundary Detector** (2-3 days)

```bash
# Create new file
touch app/services/context/episode_boundary_detector.py

# Implement detector class
# See: docs/plans/PHASE_4_PLUS_ROADMAP.md for design
```

**Test Cases**:
- Topic shift detection
- Time gap handling
- Explicit markers ("new topic", "changing subject")
- Continuity preservation

**Task 2: Integrate with Chat Handler** (1 day)

```python
# In app/handlers/chat.py

# After storing message
boundary_detected = await boundary_detector.detect_boundary(
    recent_messages=recent_window,
    new_message=current_message,
)

if boundary_detected:
    # Create episode from window
    asyncio.create_task(
        episodic_memory.create_episode_from_window(window)
    )
```

**Task 3: Test in Production** (2 days)

- Monitor episode creation
- Verify boundary detection accuracy
- Tune thresholds based on results

### 2. Implement Importance Scoring

**Goal**: Score conversations for episode creation

**Task**: Create scorer class (1-2 days)

```bash
touch app/services/context/importance_scorer.py
```

**Factors to score**:
- Conversation length
- User engagement (# participants)
- Bot participation
- Question density
- Emotional intensity

**Testing**: Compare scores with manual judgment

### 3. Collect Quality Metrics

Track context quality improvements:

```python
# Add to handlers/chat.py

# After Gemini response
await telemetry.record_context_quality(
    context_tokens=context_assembly.total_tokens,
    levels_used={
        "immediate": len(context_assembly.immediate.messages),
        "recent": len(context_assembly.recent.messages) if context_assembly.recent else 0,
        # etc.
    },
    response_length=len(reply_text),
    user_satisfaction=None,  # To be collected
)
```

## Long Term (Next Month+)

### Phase 5: Fact Graphs (Week 7)

**Preparation**:
1. Research entity extraction libraries
2. Design graph schema
3. Prototype relationship inference
4. Plan migration for existing facts

**Key Deliverables**:
- Entity extraction from conversations
- Relationship inference between facts
- Graph-based retrieval (multi-hop queries)
- Fact clustering

### Phase 6: Temporal & Adaptive Memory (Weeks 8-10)

**Preparation**:
1. Design fact versioning schema
2. Plan importance decay algorithms
3. Prototype memory consolidation
4. Design adaptive retrieval logic

**Key Deliverables**:
- Fact versioning (track changes over time)
- Importance decay (fade old memories)
- Memory consolidation (merge related facts)
- Adaptive retrieval (context-aware)

### Phase 7: Optimization (Weeks 13-14)

**Preparation**:
1. Collect performance baselines
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Design deduplication strategy
4. Plan streaming assembly

**Key Deliverables**:
- Smart deduplication across levels
- Streaming context assembly
- Adaptive budget allocation
- Relevance feedback loop

## Risk Management

### Monitor These Risks

**Risk 1: Performance Degradation**

**Warning Signs**:
- Assembly time >1s frequently
- High fallback rate (>5%)
- User complaints about speed

**Mitigation**:
```bash
# Quick fix: Reduce budget
CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET=4000

# Or disable multi-level temporarily
ENABLE_MULTI_LEVEL_CONTEXT=false
```

**Risk 2: Database Growth**

**Warning Signs**:
- Database >1GB
- Query times increasing
- Disk space warnings

**Mitigation**:
```bash
# Check size
ls -lh gryag.db

# If too large, prune old messages
sqlite3 gryag.db "DELETE FROM messages WHERE ts < strftime('%s', 'now', '-90 days');"

# Rebuild indexes
sqlite3 gryag.db "VACUUM; ANALYZE; PRAGMA optimize;"
```

**Risk 3: Quality Regression**

**Warning Signs**:
- Poor context selection
- Irrelevant results
- User confusion

**Mitigation**:
```bash
# Tune search weights
SEMANTIC_WEIGHT=0.6
KEYWORD_WEIGHT=0.2

# Or increase relevance threshold
# (requires code change in hybrid_search.py)
```
