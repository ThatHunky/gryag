"""
Verification script for command throttle middleware fix.

This script verifies that the CommandThrottleMiddleware correctly handles
commands addressed to different bots and only throttles commands that are
registered to gryag.

Bug fix: The bot was throttling ALL commands (including those for other bots),
which caused it to send throttle messages to users even when they were using
commands for a different bot.

Expected behavior:
- /gryag -> throttle (gryag's command)
- /gryagban -> throttle (gryag's command)
- /dban -> pass through (unknown command, likely for another bot)
- /start -> pass through (not a gryag command)
- /gryag@this_bot -> throttle (command for this bot)
- /gryag@other_bot -> pass through (command for different bot)
