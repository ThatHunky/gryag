# TODO: Rewrite tests for new simplified memory system
# The old fact-based system has been replaced with a simpler memory system.
# These tests need to be completely rewritten to work with:
# - MemoryRepository instead of UnifiedFactRepository
# - remember_memory_tool, recall_memories_tool, forget_memory_tool, forget_all_memories_tool
# - Simple memory strings instead of structured facts
