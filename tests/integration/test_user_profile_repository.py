# TODO: Update tests for new memory system
# UserFact class has been deprecated and replaced with simple memories in MemoryRepository.
# These tests should either be:
# 1. Removed if they're testing deprecated functionality
# 2. Rewritten to test MemoryRepository instead
# 3. Updated to test only UserProfile CRUD operations (without facts)
